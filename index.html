        <div class="contentText">Hashkafa
(Hebrew: השקפה‎; lit. “overview”) means to survey. But to take a survey
of what? The grand design underlying reality, as described in the
Torah. Some of the questions that hashkafa might answer:<br />
What is existence? (Ontology)
<p>What does it mean to exist? What are the prime entities that exists
and what is the relationship (plan) that links these entities?</p>
<p>What is the greatest Being, the source of all other being?</p>
<p>How do we know that the Torah’s description of the universe — created with plan and purpose — is true? (Epistemology)</p>
<p>Who is God? What has he allowed us to understand about His essence?</p>
<p>Why did He create the universe?</p>
<p>Why did He create Man?</p>
<p>Why did He create man in his current form? Why is his head on top,
and his heart in the middle of his body? Why two eyes, but one mouth?</p>
<p>What is the psychological structure of man?</p>
<p>What is evil? Why is there evil?</p>
<p>Why must man suffer pain?</p>
<p>What does God want of us? Why?</p>
<p>What is a Jew ( not halachicly) but from the point of view of hashkafa? Why is Israel the chosen nation? What does that mean?</p>
<p>Why was Adam HaRishon (the first man) not a Jew?</p>
<p>Why is there a Messianic era?</p>
<p>What is Olam Haba (the world to come)?</p>
