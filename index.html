        <div class="contentText">Hashkafa
(Hebrew: השקפה‎; lit. “overview”) means to survey. But to take a survey
of what? The grand design underlying reality, as described in the
Torah. Some of the questions that hashkafa might answer:<br />
<ul>
  <li>What is existence? (Ontology)</li>
  <li>What does it mean to exist? What are the prime entities that
exists and what is the relationship (plan) that links these entities?</li>
  <li>What is the greatest Being, the source of all other being?</li>
  <li>How do we know that the Torah’s description of the universe — created with plan and purpose — is true? (Epistemology). For one method, see 
  <a href="toriah/post/mount-sinai/">Mount Sinai</a>
  </li>
  <li>Who is G-d? What has he allowed us to understand about His essence?</li>
  <li>Why did He create the universe?</li>
   <li>What is the relationship between Torah and Science?</li>
  <li>Why did He create Man?</li>
  <li>What is the psychological structure of man?</li>
  <li>What is evil? Why is there evil?</li>
  <li>Why must man suffer pain?</li>
  <li>What does God want of us? Why?</li>
  <li>What is a Jew ( not halachicly) but from the point of view of hashkafa? Why is Israel the chosen nation? What does that mean?</li>
  <li>Why was Adam HaRishon (the first man) not a Jew?</li>
  <li>Why is there a Messianic era?</li>
  <li>What is Olam Haba (the world to come)?</li>
</ul>
This site is under construction. Over time it is hoped to add articles of interest.<p>&nbsp;</p>
