<p><b><font face="Verdana">Articles on Rav Dessler's approach to time, creation and 
evolution</font></b></p>

<ul>
	<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="Vol2.htm">Volume II - Pages 
	150-154</a>. Rav Dessler zt&quot;l explains the importance of each moment of time. Rav 
	Dessler quotes the Ramban to the effect that the six days of creation were 
	six actual days, but each day also refers to a deeper spiritual dimension. 
	Adam HaRishon was tuned into that spiritual reality much more than we are 
	today to the point that his <i>perception</i> of time was focused at this 
	spiritual level rather than on the clock-time within which his physical life 
	was taking place. Rav Dessler explain this with his <i>mashal</i> of a child 
	for whom one year is imprinted in his memory as a duration that is far 
	longer than that of a year of maturity because to the child, everything is 
	new. One year for the child and adult are the same clock time but their <i>
	perception</i> of that period of real time is very different.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Volume IV - Pages 113-114 (<a href="Vol4-pages-p113.pdf">pdf</a>). 
	Rav Dessler zt&quot;l states that the purpose of clock time is to facilitate the 
	perception by man of spiritual essence. The true scope of creation is far 
	more profound than our ability to grasp and far greater than that which is 
	represented in our physical universe. Consequently, “creation” as a whole, 
	encompassing all of its deeper, more profound levels transcends any 
	limitations of time. The concept of something being “beyond the limitations 
	of time” cannot be fully grasped by the human intellect. Thus when 
	considering the idea of something being “beyond the limitations of time”, 
	it is projected into our minds as endless periods of time rather than 
	timelessness. This is why it seems (<i>nireh</i>) to scientists as if (<i>ke-ilo)</i> 
	the world evolved over millions of years. If it is true that nature of 
	creation is so much more elevated than the mundane parameters that accompany 
	our universe, why then does the Torah establish the description of creation 
	in terms of six physical days? The answer is that the Torah wanted to 
	teach us that the existence [i.e. spiritual essence] of all things is only in 
	proportion to the spiritual content it possesses. Something that contains 
	much materialism and little spirituality - its value and true existence is 
	small because the existence of everything is determined solely according 
	to the measure of its spiritual content. Thus our vast and complex universe 
	did not need billions of years to come into being but only 6 days.<br>

	<b>&nbsp;Two Refutations to the Claims of the Evolutionists</b>: Rabbi 
	Dessler zt&quot;l shows that the geological formations and embryological development 
	described by the scientists could very well have been speeded up thus rejecting 
	their temporal calculations regarding the duration of the existence of the 
	world. Rabbi Dessler rejects the millions (or billions) of years proposed by 
	the evolutionists. See also page 357 in Volume IV.<br>
