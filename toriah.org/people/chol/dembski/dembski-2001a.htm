<h2>Is Intelligent Design Testable?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr align="left"><b><font size="-1">William A. Dembski</font></b><font size="-1"> 
01.24.01</font> 
<p>Eugenie Scott is a physical anthropologist who as director of the National 
Center for Science Education travels the United States warning audiences about 
the threat of creationism and unmasking its various guises. Intelligent design, 
according to her, is currently the most sinister of these guises. Scott has 
developed a standard shtick, which includes not only some well-worn arguments 
against creationism and some newer arguments against intelligent design (which 
she refers to as &quot;neocreationism&quot;) but also some comedic elements, like the 
Monty Python wink-wink-nudge-nudge routine, which she uses when she wants to 
make clear to her audiences that the designer of intelligent design is really 
none other than the &quot;Big G&quot; of the Christian faith. </p>
<p>Recently (January 18, 2001) Scott presented a lecture at U.C. Berkeley 
sponsored by the department of integrative biology and titled &quot;Icons of 
Creationism: The New Anti-Evolutionism and Science&quot; (http://ib.berkeley.edu/seminars/index.html). 
The title alludes to Jonathan Wells's recent book _Icons of Evolution_, which 
critiques the various standard evidences used in textbooks to support Darwinian 
evolution. Scott presumably means to turn the tables and show that intelligent 
design is similarly open to criticism. </p>
<p>Scott's key criticism against intelligent design, both in her talk the other 
day and since the early nineties, has been that intelligent design is untestable. 
For instance, in an exchange with Stephen Meyer back in 1994 in _Insight_ 
magazine, Scott remarked that until design theorists develop a &quot;theo-meter&quot; 
(this neologism is hers) to test for design, they are treading water in a sea of 
retarded scientific aspirations. In her talk the other day at U.C. Berkeley she 
claimed that intelligent design does not propose any &quot;testable model.&quot; </p>
<p>The testability objection to intelligent design can be interpreted in two 
ways. One is to claim that intelligent design is in principle untestable. This 
seems to have been Scott's line in the early nineties. Certainly it is a 
hallmark of science that any of its claims be subject to revision or refutation 
on the basis of new evidence or further theoretical insight. If this is what one 
means by testability, then design is certainly testable. Indeed, it was in this 
sense that Darwin tested William Paley's account of design and found it wanting. 
It simply won't wash to say that design isn't testable and then in the same 
breath say that Darwin tested design and refuted it. </p>
<p>The other way to interpret the testability objection is to claim that 
intelligent design may in principle be testable, but that no tests have been 
proposed to date. This seems to be Scott's line currently. Indeed, if the 
testability objection is to bear any weight, its force must reside in the 
absence of concrete proposals for testing intelligent design. Are such proposals 
indeed lacking? Rather than looking solely at the testability of intelligent 
design, I want also to consider the testability of Darwinism. By comparing the 
testability of the two theories, it will become evident that even the more 
charitable interpretation of Scott's testability objection does not hold up. </p>
<p>In relation to science testability is a very broad notion. It certainly 
includes Karl Popper's notion of falsifiability, but it is hardly coextensive 
with it and can apply even if falsifiability does not obtain. Testability as 
well covers confirmation, predicability, and explanatory power. At the heart of 
testability is the idea that our scientific theories must make contact with and 
be sensitive to what's happening in nature. What's happening in nature must be 
able to affect our scientific theories not only in form and content but also in 
the degree of credence we attach to or withhold from them. For a theory to be 
immune to evidence from nature is a sure sign that we're not dealing with a 
scientific theory. </p>
<p>What then are we to make of the testability of both intelligent design and 
Darwinism taken not in a generic abstract sense but concretely? What are the 
specific tests for intelligent design? What are the specific tests for 
Darwinism? And how do the two theories compare in terms of testability? To 
answer these questions, let's run through several aspects of testability, 
beginning with falsifiability. </p>
<p>FALSIFIABILITY: Is intelligent design falsifiable? Is Darwinism falsifiable? 
Yes to the first question, no to the second. Intelligent design is eminently 
falsifiable. Specified complexity in general and irreducible complexity in 
biology are within the theory of intelligent design the key markers of 
intelligent agency. If it could be shown that biological systems like the 
bacterial flagellum that are wonderfully complex, elegant, and integrated could 
have been formed by a gradual Darwinian process (which by definition is 
non-telic), then intelligent design would be falsified on the general grounds 
that one doesn't invoke intelligent causes when purely natural causes will do. 
In that case Occam's razor finishes off intelligent design quite nicely. </p>
<p>On the other hand, falsifying Darwinism seems effectively impossible. To do 
so one must show that no conceivable Darwinian pathway could have led to a given 
biological structure. What's more, Darwinists are apt to retreat into the murk 
of historical contingency to shore up their theory. For instance, Allen Orr in 
his critique of Behe's work shortly after _Darwin's Black Box_ appeared 
remarked, &quot;We have no guarantee that we can reconstruct the history of a 
biochemical pathway.&quot; What he conceded with one hand, however, he was quick to 
retract with the other. He added, &quot;But even if we can't, its irreducible 
complexity cannot count against its gradual evolution.&quot; </p>
<p>The fact is that for complex systems like the bacterial flagellum no 
biologist has or is anywhere close to reconstructing its history in Darwinian 
terms. Is Darwinian theory therefore falsified? Hardly. I have yet to witness 
one committed Darwinist concede that any feature of nature might even in 
principle provide countervailing evidence to Darwinism. In place of such a 
concession one is instead always treated to an admission of ignorance. Thus it's 
not that Darwinism has been falsified or disconfirmed, but that we simply don't 
know enough about the biological system in question and its historical context 
to determine how the Darwinian mechanism might have produced it. </p>
<p>For instance, to neutralize the challenge that the irreducible complexity of 
the bacterial flagellum raises against Darwinism, Ken Miller employs the 
following argument from ignorance. Like the rest of the biological community, 
Miller doesn't know how the bacterial flagellum originated. The biological 
community's ignorance about the flagellum, however, doesn't end with its origin 
but extends to its very functioning. For instance, according to David DeRosier, 
&quot;The mechanism of the flagellar motor remains a mystery.&quot; Miller takes this 
admission of ignorance by DeRosier and uses it to advantage. In _Finding 
Darwin's God_ he writes: &quot;Before [Darwinian] evolution is excoriated for failing 
to explain the evolution of the flagellum, I'd request that the scientific 
community at least be allowed to figure out how its various parts work.&quot; But in 
the article by DeRosier that Miller cites, Miller conveniently omits the 
following quote: &quot;More so than other motors, the flagellum resembles a machine 
designed by a human.&quot; </p>
<p>So apparently we know enough about the bacterial flagellum to know that it is 
designed or at least design-like. Indeed, we know what most of its individual 
parts do. Moreover, we know that the flagellum is irreducibly complex. Far from 
being a weakness of irreducible complexity as Miller suggests, it is a strength 
of the concept that one can determine whether a system is irreducibly complex 
without knowing the precise role that each part in the system plays (one need 
only knock out individual parts and see if function is preserved; knowing what 
exactly the individual parts do is not necessary). Miller's appeal to ignorance 
obscures just how much we know about the flagellum, how compelling the case is 
for its design, and how unfalsifiable Darwinism is when Darwinists proclaim that 
the Darwinian selection mechanism can account for it despite the absence of any 
identifiable biochemical pathway. </p>
<p>CONFIRMATION: What about positive evidence for intelligent design and 
Darwinism? From the design theorist's perspective, the positive evidence for 
Darwinism is confined to small-scale evolutionary changes like insects 
developing insecticide resistance. This is not to deny large-scale evolutionary 
changes, but it is to deny that the Darwinian mechanism can account for them. 
Evidence like that for insecticide resistance confirms the Darwinian selection 
mechanism for small-scale changes, but hardly warrants the grand extrapolation 
that Darwinists want. It is a huge leap going from insects developing 
insecticide resistance via the Darwinian mechanism of natural selection and 
random variation to the very emergence of insects in the first place by that 
same mechanism. </p>
<p>Darwinists invariably try too minimize the extrapolation from small-scale to 
large-scale evolution, arguing that it is a failure of imagination on the part 
of critics to appreciate the wonder-working power of the Darwinian mechanism. 
From the design theorist's perspective, however, this is not a case of failed 
imagination but of the emperor's new clothes. Yes, there is positive evidence 
for Darwinism, but the strength and relevance of that evidence on behalf of 
large-scale evolution is very much under dispute, if not within the Darwinian 
community then certainly outside of it. </p>
<p>What about the positive evidence for intelligent design? It seems that here 
we may be getting to the heart of Eugenie Scott's concerns. I submit that there 
is indeed positive evidence for intelligent design. To see this, let's consider 
an example that I recycle endlessly in my writings (if only because its force 
seems continually lost on Darwinists). Consider the movie _Contact_ that 
appeared summer of 1997, based on the novel by Carl Sagan. In the movie radio 
astronomers determine that they have established contact with an 
extraterrestrial intelligence after they receive a long sequence of prime 
numbers, represented as a sequence of bits. </p>
<p>Although in the actual SETI program (Search for Extraterrestrial 
Intelligence) radio astronomers look not for something as flamboyant as prime 
numbers but something much more plebeian, namely, a narrow bandwidth of 
transmissions (as occur with human radio transmissions), the point nonetheless 
remains that SETI researchers would legitimately count a sequence of prime 
numbers (and less flamboyantly though just as assuredly a narrow bandwidth 
transmission) as positive evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence. No such 
conclusive signal has yet been observed, but I can assure you that if it were to 
be observed, Eugenie Scott would not be complaining about SETI not having 
proposed any &quot;testable models.&quot; Instead she would rejoice that the model had 
been tested and decisively confirmed. </p>
<p>Now what's significant about a sequence of prime numbers from outer space is 
that they exhibit specified complexity -- there has to be a long sequence (hence 
complexity) and it needs to display an independently given pattern (hence 
specificity). But what if specified complexity is also exhibited in actual 
biological systems? In fact it is -- notably in the bacterial flagellum. 
Internet mavens have been pestering me for actual calculations of complexity 
involved in such systems. I address this in my forthcoming book (_No Free 
Lunch_), but such calculations are out there in the literature (cf. the work of 
Hubert Yockey, Robert Sauer, Peter R&uuml;st, Paul Erbrich, Siegfried Scherer, and 
most recently Douglas Axe -- I'm not enlisting these individuals as design 
advocates but merely pointing out that methods for determining specified 
complexity are already part of biology). </p>
<p>Even so, it appears that Eugenie Scott would not be entirely happy admitting 
that intelligent design is positively confirmed once some clear-cut instances of 
specified complexity are discovered in biological systems. Why not? As she put 
it in her U.C. Berkeley lecture, design theorists &quot;never tell you what 
happened.&quot; Well, neither do SETI researchers. If a SETI researcher discovers a 
radio transmission of prime numbers from outer space, the inference to an 
extraterrestrial intelligence is clear, but the researcher doesn't know &quot;what 
happened&quot; in the sense of knowing any details about the radio transmitter or for 
that matter the extraterrestrial that transmitted the radio transmission. </p>
<p>Ah, but we have experience with radio transmitters. At least with 
extraterrestrial intelligences we can guess what might have happened. But we 
don't have any experience with unembodied designers, and that's clearly what 
we're dealing with when it comes to design in biology. Actually, if an 
unembodied designer is responsible for biological complexity, then we do have 
quite a bit of experience with such a designer through the designed objects (not 
least ourselves) that confront us all the time. On the other hand, it is true 
that we possess very little insight at this time into how such a designer acted 
to bring about the complex biological systems that have emerged over the course 
of natural history. </p>
<p>Darwinists take this present lack of insight into the workings of an 
unembodied designer not as remediable ignorance on our part and not as evidence 
that the designer's capacities far outstrip ours, but as proof that there is no 
unembodied designer (at least none relevant to biology). By the same token, if 
an extraterrestrial intelligence communicated via radio signals with earth and 
solved computational problems that exceeded anything an ordinary or quantum 
computer could ever solve, we would have to conclude that we weren't really 
dealing with an intelligence because we have no experience of 
super-mathematicians that can solve such problems. My own view is that with 
respect to biological design humans are in the same position as William James's 
dog studying James while James was reading a book in his library. Our 
incomprehension over biological design is the incomprehension of a dog trying to 
understand its master's actions. Interestingly, the biological community 
regularly sings the praises of natural selection and the wonders it has wrought 
while admitting that it has no comprehension of how those wonders were wrought. 
Natural selection, we are assured, is cleverer than we are or can ever hope to 
be. Darwinists have merely swapped one form of awe for another. They've not 
eliminated it. </p>
<p>It is no objection at all that we don't at this time know how an unembodied 
designer produced a biological system that exhibits specified complexity. We 
know that specified complexity is reliably correlated with the effects of 
intelligence. The only reason to insist on looking for non-telic explanations to 
explain the complex specified structures in biology is because of prior 
commitment to naturalism that perforce excludes unembodied designers. It is 
illegitimate, scientifically and rationally, to claim on a priori grounds that 
such entities do not exist, or if they do exist that they can have no 
conceivable relevance to what happens in the world. Do such entities exist? Can 
they have empirical consequences? Are they relevant to what happens in the 
world? Such questions cannot be prejudged except on metaphysical grounds. To 
prejudge these questions the way Eugenie Scott does is therefore to make certain 
metaphysical commitments about what there is and what has the capacity to 
influence events in the world. Such commitments are utterly gratuitous to the 
practice of science. Specified complexity confirms design regardless whether the 
designer responsible for it is embodied or unembodied. </p>
<p>PREDICTABILITY: Another aspect of testability is predictability. A good 
scientific theory, we are told, is one that predicts things. If it predicts 
things that don't happen, then it is tested and found wanting. If it predicts 
things that do happen, then it is tested and regarded as successful. If it 
doesn't predict things, however, what then? Often with theories that try to 
account for features of natural history, prediction gets generalized to include 
retrodiction, in which a theory also specifies what the past should look like. 
Darwinism is said to apply retrodictively to the fossil record and predictively 
in experiments that place an organism under selection pressures and attempt to 
induce some adaptive change. </p>
<p>But in fact Darwinism does not retrodict the fossil record. Natural selection 
and random variation applied to single-celled organisms offers no insight at all 
into whether we can expect multi-celled organisms, much less whether evolution 
will produce the various body-plans of which natural history has left us a 
record. At best one can say that there is consilience, i.e., that the broad 
sweep of evolutionary history as displayed in the fossil record is consistent 
with Darwinian evolution. Design theorists strongly dispute this as well 
(pointing especially to the Cambrian explosion). But detailed retrodiction and 
detailed prediction are not virtues of Darwin's theory. Organisms placed under 
selection pressures either adapt or go extinct. Except in the simplest cases 
where there is, say, some point mutation that reliably confers antibiotic 
resistance on a bacterium, Darwin's theory has no way of predicting just what 
sorts of adaptive changes will occur. &quot;Adapt or go extinct&quot; is not a prediction 
of Darwin's theory but an axiom that can be reasoned out independently. </p>
<p>Challenging me in _American Outlook_ biologist Alex Duncan remarked: &quot;A 
scientific theory makes predictions about the world around us, and enables us to 
ask and answer meaningful questions. For example, we might pose the question 
'why do polar bears have fur, while penguins have feathers, given the similar 
nature of their environments<br>
Evolution provides an answer to this question. The only answer creationism (or 
intelligent design) provides is 'because God made them that way.'&quot; Actually, 
evolution, whether Darwinian or otherwise, makes no predictions about there 
being bears or birds at all or for that matter bears having fur and birds having 
feathers. Once bears or birds are on the scene, they need to adapt to their 
environment or die. Intelligent design can accommodate plenty of evolutionary 
change and allows for natural selection to act as a conservative force to keep 
organisms adapted to their environments. Contrary to Duncan's remark, 
intelligent design does not push off all explanation to the inscrutable will of 
God. On the other hand, intelligent design utterly rejects natural selection as 
a creative force capable of bringing about the specified complexity we see in 
organisms. </p>
<p>It's evident, then, that Darwin's theory has virtually no predictive power. 
Insofar as it offers predictions, they are either extremely general, concerning 
the broad sweep of natural history and in that respect quite questionable (Why 
else would Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge need to introduce punctuated 
equilibria if the fossil record were such an overwhelming vindication of 
Darwinism?); and when the predictions are not extremely general they are 
extremely specific and picayune, dealing with small-scale adaptive changes. 
Newton was able to predict the path that a planet traces out. Darwin's disciples 
can neither predict nor retrodict the pathways that organisms trace out in the 
course of natural history. </p>
<p>But what about the predictive power of intelligent design? To require 
prediction fundamentally misconstrues design. To require prediction of design is 
to put design in the same boat as natural laws, locating their explanatory power 
in an extrapolation from past experience. This is to commit a category mistake. 
To be sure, designers, like natural laws, can behave predictably (designers 
often institute policies that end up being rigidly obeyed). Yet unlike natural 
laws, which are universal and uniform, designers are also innovators. 
Innovation, the emergence to true novelty, eschews predictability. Designers are 
inventors. We cannot predict what an inventor would do short of becoming that 
inventor. Intelligent design offers a radically different problematic for 
science than a mechanistic science wedded solely to undirected natural causes. 
Yes, intelligent design concedes predictability. But this represents no 
concession to Darwinism, for which the minimal predictive power that it has can 
readily be assimilated to a design-theoretic framework. </p>
<p>EXPLANATORY POWER: According to Darwin the great advantage of his theory over 
William Paley's theory of design was that Darwin's theory managed to account for 
a wide diversity of biological facts that Paley's theory could not. Darwin's 
theory was thus thought to have greater explanatory power than Paley's , and 
this relative advantage could be viewed as a test of the two theories. 
Underlying explanatory power is a view of explanation known as inference to the 
best explanation in which a &quot;best explanation&quot; always presupposes at least two 
competing explanations and attempts to determine which comes out on top. Design 
theorists see advances in the biological and information sciences as putting 
design back in the saddle and enabling it to outperform Darwinism, thus making 
design currently the best explanation biological complexity. Darwinists of 
course see the matter quite differently. </p>
<p>What I want to focus on here, however, is not the testing of Darwinism and 
design against the broad body of biological data, but the related question of 
which theory can accommodate the greater range of biological possibilities. 
Think of it this way: Are there things that might occur in biology for which a 
design-theoretic framework could give a better, more accurate account than a 
purely Darwinian and therefore non-teleological framework? The answer is yes.
</p>
<p>First off, let's be clear that design can accommodate all the results of 
Darwinism. Intelligent design does not repudiate the Darwinian mechanism. It 
merely assigns it a lower status than Darwinism does. The Darwinian mechanism 
does operate in nature and insofar as it does, design can live with its 
deliverances. Even if the Darwinian mechanism could be shown to do all the 
design work for which design theorists want to invoke design (say for the 
bacterial flagellum), a design-theoretic framework would not destroy any valid 
findings of science. To be sure, design would then become superfluous, but it 
would not become contradictory or self-refuting. </p>
<p>The same cannot be said for Darwinism and the naturalism it embodies as a 
framework for science. Suppose I were a super-genius molecular biologist, and I 
invented some hitherto unknown molecular machine, far more complicated and 
marvelous than the bacterial flagellum. Suppose further I inserted this machine 
into a bacterium, set this genetically modified organism free, allowed it to 
reproduce in the wild, and destroyed all evidence of my having created the 
molecular machine. Suppose, for instance, the machine is a stinger that injects 
other bacteria and explodes them by rapidly pumping them up with some gas (I'm 
not familiar with any such molecular machine in the wild), thereby allowing the 
bacteria endowed with my invention to consume their unfortunate prey. </p>
<p>Now let's ask the question, If a Darwinist came upon this bacterium with the 
novel molecular machine in the wild, would that machine be attributed to design 
or to natural selection? When I presented this example to David Sloan Wilson at 
a conference at MIT two years ago, he shrugged it off and remarked that natural 
selection created us and so by extension also created my novel molecular 
machine. But of course this argument won't wash since the issue is whether 
natural selection could indeed create us. What's more, if Darwinists came upon 
my invention of a novel molecular machine inserted into a bacterium that allows 
it to feed on other bacteria, they wouldn't look to design but would reflexively 
turn to natural selection. But, if we go with the story, I designed the 
bacterial stinger and natural selection had nothing to do with it. Moreover, 
intelligent design would confirm the stinger's design whereas Darwinism never 
could. It follows that a design-theoretic framework could account for biological 
facts that would forever remain invisible within a Darwinian framework. It seems 
to me that this possibility constitutes a joint test of Darwinism and 
intelligent design that strongly supports intelligent design -- if not as the 
truth then certainly as a live possible theoretical option that must not be 
precluded for a priori philosophical reasons like naturalism. </p>
<p>In conclusion, there is no merit to Eugenie Scott's claim that intelligent 
design is untestable or hasn't put forward any &quot;testable models.&quot; Intelligent 
design's claims about specified and irreducible complexity are in close contact 
with the data of biology and open to refutation as well as confirmation. What's 
more, as a framework for doing science intelligent design is more robust and 
sensitive to the possibilities that nature might actually throw our way than 
Darwinism, which must view everything through the lens of chance and necessity 
and take a reductive approach to all signs of teleology in nature. </p>
<p>But isn't intelligent design just a stone's throw from fundamentalist 
Christianity and rabid creationism? Even if a theory of intelligent design 
should ultimately prove successful and supersede Darwinism, it would not follow 
that the designer posited by this theory would have to be the Christian God or 
for that matter be real in some ontological sense. One can be an anti-realist 
about science and simply regard the designer as a regulative principle -- a 
conceptually useful device for making sense out of certain facts of biology -- 
without assigning the designer any weight in reality. Wittgenstein, for 
instance, regarded the theories of Copernicus and Darwin not as true but as 
&quot;fertile new points of view.&quot; </p>
<p>Ultimately, the main question that confronts scientists working on a theory 
of intelligent design is whether design provides powerful new insights and 
fruitful avenues of research. The metaphysics underlying such a theory, and in 
particular the ontological status of the designer, can then be taken up by 
philosophy and theology. Indeed, one's metaphysics ought to be a matter of 
indifference to one's scientific theorizing about design. The fact that it is 
not for Eugenie Scott says more about her own biases than about the biases of 
design theorists, whose primary task is to explore the fruitfulness of design 
for science. Yes, we've got our work cut out for us. But instead of facilitating 
that work, Scott and her National Center for Science Education are far more 
interested in exiling that work to oblivion. Fortunately, design theorists have 
suffered exile for so long at the hands of Darwinists that we've learned to 
operate effectively even in oblivion. </p>
