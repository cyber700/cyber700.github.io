<p><b>Abstract:</b> Competing data and theories now make the Big Bang theory, 
presumed by cosmologist since the 1960s, to be far less certain. A history of 
cosmology accompanies an examination of new data, from the Hubble telescope and 
other sources. </p>

<p>SCIENCE IS a congeries of great quests, and cosmology is the grandest of the 
great quests. Taking as its province the universe as a whole, cosmology 
addresses the old, the ineradicable questions about space and time, nature and 
destiny. It is not a subject for the tame or the timid. </p>
<p>For the first half of the 20th century, cosmology remained a discipline 
apart, as a clutch of talented but otherworldly physicists peeped inconclusively 
at a universe they could barely see: Albert Einstein, of course; the Dutch 
mathematician Willem de Sitter; the Belgian abbot Georges Lemaitre; and the 
extraordinary Russian mathematician and meteorologist Aleksandr Friedmann, 
destined to die young, or so the story has it, from exposure to the elements 
suffered while soaring above Moscow in a weather balloon. </p>
<p>When in 1917 Einstein published his first estimates of the size and shape of 
the universe, telescopes could not penetrate the heavens beyond the Milky Way. 
Like a sailor endeavoring to measure the depth of the sea from the shore, 
astronomers lacked the means to probe the heavens further or to probe them in 
detail. </p>
<p>This has now changed. Information pours from the night skies, terrestrial 
telescopes hissing and clicking as they rotate to survey distant galaxies. 
Somewhere in space, the realigned Hubble telescope peers into the unpolluted 
depths. Physicists have pictures of the backside of beyond, and they appear to 
have overheard the cosmic cackle that accompanied the very crack of time, as 
nothingness gave way to light. The cosmologists have come into their own, 
handling the universe with an easy familiarity and writing book after book in 
which they explain in exuberant detail how the great things were done. </p>
<p>The Great Cause </p>
<p>WHATEVER THE dreams we dream, the existence of the universe has always seemed 
a riddle beyond reason, if only because our imagination is forever suspended 
between ideas of creation and timelessness. Many ancient myths depict the 
universe as the effect of some Great Cause. In the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish, 
existence is attributed to congress between &quot;primordial Aspu, the Begetter&quot; and 
&quot;Mummu-Tiamet, she who bore them all.&quot; Although the connection cosmic and sexual 
energies is both familiar and disturbing, it is not congress between gods that 
is crucial to the myth but the idea that the universe came into being as the 
result of a Great Cause. And this idea is conveyed by the opening of Genesis as 
well: &quot;In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.&quot; </p>
<p>These are words that express an authentically universal concept, one familiar 
to every culture. But while the concept of creation is common, it is also 
incoherent. &quot;I venture to ask,&quot; the 3rd-century Chinese sage Kuo Hsiang ventured 
to ask, &quot;whether the Creator is or is not. If He is not, how can He create 
things? And if He is, then (being one of these things) He is incapable (without 
self-creation) of creating the mass of bodily forms.&quot; That this argument is 
simple is no reason to think it wrong. </p>
<p>If not creation by a Great Cause, what, then, of timelessness: a universe 
proceeding sedately from everlasting to everlasting? In Maori myth, the world 
parents who bring the cosmos into being arise themselves from po, a kind of 
antecedent gruel or stuff, so that the universe appears as an episode in an 
infinitely extended drama. Some variant of this idea is also universal, a place 
in every culture where the weary mind takes refuge. Yet if timelessness offers 
an escape from the paradoxes of creation, the escape can easily seem an evasion. 
An everlasting universe is itself an object requiring explanation: if it is 
unprofitable to ask? when it arose, one nonetheless wonders why the damn thing 
should be there at all. </p>
<p>It is the remarkable claim of contemporary cosmology to have broken, and 
broken decisively, the restless movement of the mind as it passes from theory to 
theory and from myth to myth. &quot;Incomplete though it may be,&quot; one physicist has 
written, &quot;the scope of modern scientific understanding of the cosmos is truly 
dazzling.&quot; This is not hyperbole. It is an assessment widely shared among 
physicists, and thus the standard by which their claims must be judged. </p>
<p>The universe, cosmologists now affirm, came into existence as the expression 
of an explosion, the cosmos shaking itself into existence from the bang of an 
initial singularity. It is tempting to think of the event in humanly 
comprehensible terms--a gigantic explosion or a stupendous? eruption, as if, 
popcorn in hand, we were watching the show from far away. But this is absurd. 
The Big Bang was not an event taking place at a time or in a place. Space and 
time were themselves created by the Big Bang, the measure along with the 
measured. </p>
<p>As far as most physicists are concerned, the Big Bang is now a part of the 
structure of serene indubitability created by modern physics, an event 
undeniable as the volcanic explosion at Krakatoa. From time to time, it is true, 
the astrophysical journals report the failure of observation to confirm the 
grand design. It hardly matters. The physicists have not only persuaded 
themselves of the merits of Big Bang cosmology, they have persuaded everyone 
else as well. The Big Bang has come to signify virtually a universal creed; men 
and women who know nothing of cosmology are convinced that the rumble of 
creation lies within reach of their collective memory. </p>
<p>The Cosmic Archeologist </p>
<p>LOOKING AT a few shards of pottery on the desert floor, the archeologist is 
capable of conjuring up the hanging gardens of the past, the smell of myrrh and 
honey in the air. His is an act of intellectual reconstruction, one made 
poignant by the fact that the civilization from which the artifacts spring lies 
forever beyond the reach of anything but remembrance and the imagination. 
Cosmology on the grand scale is another form of archeology; the history of the 
cosmos reveals itself in layers, like the strata of an ancient city. </p>
<p>The world of human artifacts makes sense against the assumption of a 
continuous human culture. The universe is something else: an old, eerie place 
with no continuous culture available to enable us to make sense of what we see. 
It is the hypothesis that the universe is expanding that has given cosmologists 
a unique degree of confidence as they climb down the cliffs of time. </p>
<p>A universe that is expanding is a universe with a clear path into the past. 
If things are now far apart, they must at one point have been close together; 
and if things were once close together, they must at one point have been hotter 
than they are now, the contraction of space acting to compress its constituents 
like a vise, and so increase their energy. The retreat into the past ends at an 
initial singularity, a state in which material particles are at no distance from 
each other and the temperature, density, and curvature of the universe are 
infinite. </p>
<p>The cosmic archeologist may now be observed crawling back up the cliffs of 
time he so recently descended. During the first [10.sup.-43] seconds after the 
Big Bang--[10.sup.-43] is one over a ten followed by 42 zeros--both matter and 
radiation fill the void. A reign of fluid interchange obtains, with particles of 
matter and antimatter exchanging identities. As the primitive goo of the 
cosmos--what the physicist George Gamow called ylem, the primordial 
stuff--continues to expand, it continues to cool. Neutrinos, photons, electrons, 
positrons, neutrons, and protons agitate themselves throughout space. With the 
temperature dropping, the neutrinos decamp for parts unknown. </p>
<p>At roughly one-and-one-half seconds after the Big Bang, protons and neutrons 
lose the ability to exchange identities, and the ratio of neutrons to protons in 
the universe freezes itself at one to six. Three-and-one-half seconds later, the 
equilibrium between electrons and positrons collapses, and the positrons follow 
the neutrinos into the void. </p>
<p>Three minutes pass. The era of nucleosynthesis begins thereafter. Those 
neutrons that during the freeze-out found themselves bound to the world's 
vagrant protons now take up an identity as a form of helium. Other elements wait 
patiently for the stars to be born so that they may be cooked in their 
interiors. </p>
<p>The universe continues to expand, pulse, glow, throb, and moan for 400,000 
years more, passing insensibly from a place where radiation predominates to an 
arena where matter has taken charge and is in command. The temperature is now 
4,000 degrees Kelvin. The great era of recombination is at hand, a burst of 
cosmic creativity recorded in the walls of time. Free electrons and protons form 
hydrogen. The interaction between matter and radiation changes dramatically. </p>
<p>Until recombination, photons found themselves trapped within a cosmic pinball 
machine, ricocheting from one free charged particle to another, the cosmos 
frustratingly opaque because frustratingly dense. But hydrogen binds the cosmic 
debris, and for the first time, light streams from one side of creation to the 
other. The early universe fills with low-temperature blackbody radiation, the 
stuff destined to be observed fifteen billion years later in Princeton, New 
Jersey, as cosmic background radiation (CBR). </p>
<p>The separation of light and matter allows the galaxies to form, gravity 
binding the drifting dust in space. At last, the universe fills with matter, the 
stars settling into the sky, the far-flung suns radiating energy, the galaxies 
spreading themselves throughout the heavens. On the earth that has been newly 
made, living things shamble out of the warm oceans, the cosmic archeologist 
himself finally clambering over the lip of time to survey the scene and take 
notes on all that has occurred. </p>
<p>Such is the standard version of hot Big Bang cosmology--&quot;hot&quot; in contrast to 
scenarios in which the universe is cold, and &quot;Big Bang&quot; in contrast to various 
steady-state cosmologies in which nothing ever begins and nothing ever quite 
ends. It may seem that this archeological scenario leaves unanswered the 
question of bow the show started and merely describes the consequences of some 
Great Cause that it cannot specify and does not comprehend. But really the 
question of how the show started answers itself: before the Big Bang there was 
nothing. Darkness was upon the face of the deep. </p>
<p>Blow-Up </p>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING THE investment made by the scientific community and the 
general public in contemporary cosmology, a suspicion lingers that matters do 
not sum up as they should. Cosmologists write as if they are quite certain of 
the Big Bang, yet, within the last decade, they have found it necessary to 
augment the standard view by means of various new theories. These schemes are 
meant to solve problems that cosmologists were never at pains to acknowledge, so 
that today they are somewhat in the position of a physician reporting both that 
his patient has not been ill and that he has been successfully revived. </p>
<p>The details are instructive. It is often said, for example, that the 
physicists Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson observed the remnants of the Big Bang 
when in 1962 they detected, by means of a hum in their equipment, a signal in 
the night sky they could not explain. This is not quite correct. What Penzias 
and Wilson observed was simply the same irritating and ineradicable noise that 
has been a feature of every electrical appliance I have ever owned. What 
theoreticians like Robert Dicke inferred was something else: a connection 
between that cackle and the cosmic background radiation released into the 
universe after the era of recombination. </p>
<p>The cosmic hum is real enough, and so, too, is the fact that the universe is 
bathed in background radiation. But the era of recombination is a shimmer by the 
doors of theory, something known indirectly and only by means of its effects. 
And therein lies a puzzle. Although Big Bang cosmology does predict that the 
universe should be bathed in a milky film of radiation, it makes no predictions 
about the uniformity of its temperature. Yet, looking at the sky in every 
direction, cosmologists have discovered that the CBR has the same temperature, 
to an accuracy of one part in 100,000. </p>
<p>Why should this be so? CBR filled the universe some 400,000 years after the 
Big Bang; if its temperature thereafter is utterly and entirely the same, some 
physical agency must have brought this about. But by the time of recombination, 
the Big Bang had blown up the universe to a diameter of 90,000,000 light years. 
A physical signal--a light beam, say--sent hustling into the cosmos at Time Zero 
would, a mere 400,000 years later, be hustling still; by far the greater part of 
the universe would be untouched by its radiance, and so uninfluenced by the news 
that it carried. Since, by Einstein's theory of special relativity, nothing can 
travel faster than light itself, it follows that no physical agency would have 
had time enough to establish the homogeneity of the CBR, which appears in Big 
Bang cosmology as an arbitrary feature of the early universe, something that 
must be assumed and is not explained. </p>
<p>THEORIES OF inflation now make a useful appearance. Their animating idea 
represents a contribution to cosmology from particle physics --a rare example of 
intellectual lend-lease, and evidence that disciplines dealing with the smallest 
of objects may be relevant to disciplines dealing with the largest. Within what 
is now known as the Standard Model, the familiar arrangement in which elementary 
particles are moved by various forces gives way to a mathematically more general 
scheme in which fields replace both particles and forces as essential 
theoretical structures. A field is an expanse or expression of space, something 
like a surface in two dimensions, or the atmosphere in three, or space and time 
in four. The Standard Model in particle physics consists of a dozen or so 
fields, exchanging energy with one another and subsidizing particles by means of 
the energy they contain. </p>
<p>It is the Higgs field that originally came to play a novel role in Big Bang 
cosmology. Named after Peter Higgs, the Scottish physicist who charmed it into 
existence, the Higgs field is purely a conjectured object. Its cosmological 
potential was first noted by a young American physicist, Alan Guth. </p>
<p>Fields are structures that carry latent energy even under conditions in which 
the space they control is to all intents and purposes empty. The natural and 
stable state of the Higgs field is one in which its latent energy is at a 
minimum. Such is its true vacuum state, the word &quot;vacuum&quot; indicating that the 
field is empty, and the word &quot;true&quot; that the field is in its lowest energy 
configuration. But under certain physically possible circumstances, the Higgs 
field can find itself adventitiously trapped in a false vacuum state, a 
condition in which, like a spring, it is loaded with potential energy. It is 
thus, Guth conjectured, that the Higgs field might have found itself fluttering 
about the early universe, energetically throbbing and dying to be of use. </p>
<p>The wish is father to the act. The energy within the Higgs field is 
repulsive: it pushes things apart. When released, it contributes a massive jolt 
to the process of cosmic expansion already under way. The universe very quickly 
doubles in size. Space and time stretch themselves out. Particles zoom from one 
another. If the ordinary course of cosmic expansion is linear, inflationary 
expansion is exponential, like the gaunt, hollow-eyed guest gobbling the hors 
d'oeuvres--and everything else--at a previously decorous cocktail party. Only as 
the Higgs field tumbles down to its true vacuum state does inflation come to a 
halt, and the ordinary course of the Big Bang resume. </p>
<p>The mechanism of inflation, cosmologists cheerfully admit, is rather like one 
of those Rube Goldberg contraptions in which a door is made to open by means of 
a sequence that includes a flashing neon light, an insulting message in a 
bottle, a prizefighter wearing patent-leather shoes, and a boa constrictor with 
an aversion to milk. Nonetheless, they add, inflation provides a natural and 
plausible explanation for the fact that the CBR is uniform in temperature. If 
the universe under standard Big Bang cosmology is too large to allow a 
coordinating physical signal to reach every part of the CBR, then one redemptive 
idea is to cast around for a universe smaller than the standard one. This, 
inflation provides. Within an inflationary universe, the CBR owes its uniform 
temperature to the fact that it has been thoroughly mixed. At the end of the era 
of recombination, the CBR then surges through space like pre-warmed soup. </p>
<p>Inflation is an idea that has gripped the community of cosmologists. Whether 
it has advanced their scientific agenda is another question. As we have seen, 
standard Big Bang cosmology requires that features of the early universe such as 
the temperature of the CBR be set arbitrarily. This has seemed intellectually 
repugnant to many physicists: the goal of science is to reduce the arbitrariness 
of description. But inflationary cosmology has arbitrary features of its own, 
which, displaced from one corner of the theory, have a habit of popping up in 
another. &quot;The need for fine-tuning of the universe,&quot; the physicist David Lindley 
observed of Guth's proposal, &quot;has been obviated by fine-tuning the Higgs 
mechanism instead.&quot; So it has. </p>
<p>Soon after its introduction, Guth's model of inflation required adjustment. 
The Higgs field has been replaced by scalar fields, which, as Guth admits, &quot;in 
many cases serve no function other than the driving of inflation.&quot; These fields 
must be carefully chosen if they are to do their work, a fact that Guth again 
honestly acknowledges: &quot;Their nature cannot be deduced from known physics, and 
their detailed properties have to be hypothesized.&quot; </p>
<p>In an interesting example of inflationary theory self-applied, inflationary 
fields have undergone an exponential increase of their own. Beyond mere 
inflation, the sort of thing that with great heartiness simply blows the 
universe up, there is chaotic inflation and even &quot;eternal inflation,&quot; both of 
them the creations of the cosmologist Andrei Linde. Almost all cosmologists have 
a favored scheme; when not advancing their own, they occupy themselves 
enumerating the deficiencies of the others. </p>
<p>Red Stars at Night </p>
<p>STREAMING IN from space, light reaches the earth like a river rich in 
information, the stars in the sky having inscribed strange and secret messages 
on its undulations. The universe is very large, light has always whispered; the 
nearest galaxy to our own--Andromeda--is more than two million light years away. 
But the universe has also seemed relatively static, and this, too, light 
suggests, the stars appearing where they have always appeared, the familiar dogs 
and bears and girdled archers of the constellations making their appointed 
rounds m the sky each night. </p>
<p>More than anything else, it is this impression that Big Bang cosmology 
rejects. The cool gray universe, current dogma holds, is a place of 
extraordinary violence, the galaxies receding from one another, the skin of 
creation stretching at every spot in space, the whole colossal structure 
blasting apart with terrible force. And this message is inscribed in light as 
well. </p>
<p>In one of its incarnations, light represents an undulation of the 
electromagnetic field; its source is the excitable atom itself, with electrons 
bouncing from one orbit to another and releasing energy as a result. Each atom 
has a spectral signature, a distinctive electromagnetic frequency. The light 
that streams in from space thus reveals something about the composition of the 
galaxies from which it was sent. </p>
<p>In the 1920's, the characteristic signature of hydrogen was detected in 
various far-flung galaxies. And then an odd discovery was made. Examining a very 
small sample of twenty or so galaxies, the American astronomer V. M. Slipher 
observed that the frequency of the hydrogen they sent into space was shifted to 
the red portion of the spectrum. It was an extraordinary observation, achieved 
by means of primitive equipment. Using a far more sophisticated telescope, Edwin 
Hubble made the same discovery in the late 1920's after Slipher had (foolishly) 
turned his attention elsewhere. </p>
<p>The galactic redshift, Hubble realized, was an exceptionally vivid cosmic 
clue, a bit of evidence from far away and long ago, and like all clues its value 
lay in the questions it prompted. Why should galactic light be shifted to the 
red and not the blue portions of the spectrum? Why, for that matter, should it 
be shifted at all? </p>
<p>An invigorating stab in the dark now followed. The pitch of a siren is 
altered as a police car disappears down the street, the sound waves carrying the 
noise stretched by the speed of the car itself. This is the familiar Doppler 
effect. Something similar, Hubble conjectured, might explain the redshift of the 
galaxies, with the distortions in their spectral signature arising as a 
reflection of their recessional velocity as they disappeared into the depths.
</p>
<p>Observations and inferences resolved themselves into a quantitative 
relationship. The redshift of a galaxy, cosmologists affirm, and so its 
recessional velocity, is proportional to its distance and inversely proportional 
to its apparent brightness or flux. The relationship is known as Hubble's law, 
even though Hubble himself regarded the facts at his disposal with skepticism.
</p>
<p>Hubble's law anchors Big Bang cosmology to the real world. Many astronomers 
have persuaded themselves that the law represents an observation, almost as if, 
peering through his telescope, Hubble had noticed the galaxies zooming off into 
the far distance. This is nonsense. Hubble's law consolidates a number of very 
plausible intellectual steps. The light streaming in from space is relieved of 
its secrets by means of ordinary and familiar facts, but even after the facts 
are admitted into evidence, the relationship among the redshift of the galaxies, 
their recessional velocity, and their distance represents a complicated 
inference, an intellectual leap. </p>
<p>THE BIG BANG rests on the hypothesis that the universe is expanding, and in 
the end the plausibility of its claims will depend on whether the universe is 
expanding. Astronomers can indeed point to places in the sky where the redshift 
of the galaxies appears to be a linear function of their distance. But in 
astrophysics, as in evolutionary biology, it is failure rather than success that 
is of significance. The astrophysical literature contains interesting and 
disturbing evidence that the linear relationship at the heart of Hubble's law by 
no means describes the facts fully. </p>
<p>At the end of World War II, astronomers discovered places in the sky where 
charged particles moving in a magnetic field sent out strong signals in the 
radio portion of the spectrum. Twenty years later, Alan Sandage and Thomas 
Mathews identified the source of such signals with optically discernible points 
in space. These are the quasars--quasi stellar radio sources. </p>
<p>Quasars have played a singular role in astrophysics. In the mid-1960's, 
Maarten Schmidt discovered that their spectral lines were shifted massively to 
the red. If Hubble's law were correct, quasars should be impossibly far away, 
hurtling themselves into oblivion at the far edge of space and time. But for 
more than a decade, the American astronomer Halton Arp has drawn the attention 
of the astronomical community to places in the sky where the expected 
relationship between redshift and distance simply fails. Embarrassingly enough, 
many quasars seem bound to nearby galaxies. The results are in plain sight: 
there on the photographic plate is the smudged record of a galaxy, and there 
next to it is a quasar, the points of light lined up and looking for all the 
world as if they were equally luminous. </p>
<p>These observations do not comport with standard Big Bang cosmology. If 
quasars have very large redshifts, they must (according to Hubble's law) be very 
far away; if they seem nearby, then either they must be fantastically luminous 
or their redshift has not been derived from their velocity. The tight tidy 
series of inferences that has gone into Big Bang cosmology, like leverage in 
commodity trading, works beautifully in reverse, physicists like speculators 
finding their expectations canceled by the very processes they had hoped to 
exploit. </p>
<p>Acknowledging the difficulty, some theoreticians have proposed that quasars 
have been caught in the process of evolution. Others have scrupled at Arp's 
statistics. Still others have claimed that his samples are too small, although 
they have claimed this for every sample presented and will no doubt continue to 
claim this when the samples number in the billions. But whatever the excuses, a 
great many cosmologists recognize that quasars mark a point where the otherwise 
silky surface of cosmological evidence encounters a snag. </p>
<p>WITHIN ANY scientific discipline, bad news must come in battalions before it 
is taken seriously. Cosmologists can point to any number of cases in which 
disconcerting evidence has resolved itself in their favor; a decision to regard 
the quasars with a watchful indifference is not necessarily irrational. The 
galaxies are another matter. They are central to Hubble's law; it is within the 
context of galactic observation that the crucial observational evidence for the 
Big Bang must be found or forged. </p>
<p>The battalions now begin to fill. The American mathematician I.E. Segal and 
his associates have studied the evidence for galactic recessional velocity over 
the course of twenty years, with results that are sharply at odds with 
predictions of Big Bang cosmology. Segal is a distinguished, indeed a great 
mathematician, one of the creators of modern function theory and a member of the 
National Academy of Sciences. He has incurred the indignation of the 
astrophysical community by suggesting broadly that their standards of 
statistical rigor would shame a sociologist. Big Bang cosmology, he writes, </p>
<p>owes its acceptance as a physical principle </p>
<p>primarily to the uncritical and premature </p>
<p>representation of [the redshift-distance </p>
<p>relationship] as an empirical fact.... Observed </p>
<p>discrepancies . . . have been resolved by a </p>
<p>pyramid of exculpatory assumptions, which are </p>
<p>inherently incapable of noncircular </p>
<p>substantiation. </p>
<p>These are strong words of remonstration, but they are not implausible. Having 
constructed an elaborate scientific orthodoxy, cosmologists have acquired a 
vested interest in its defense. The astrophysicists J.G. Hoessell, J.E. Gunn, 
and T.X. Thuan, for example, report with satisfaction that within the structures 
described by G.O. Abell's Catalog of Bright Cluster Galaxies (1958), prediction 
and observation cohere perfectly to support Hubble's law. Abell's catalog is a 
standard astronomical resource, used by cosmologists everywhere--but it is 
useless as evidence for Hubble's law. &quot;In determining whether a cluster meets 
selection criterion,&quot; Abell affirms, &quot;it was assumed that their redshifts were 
proportional to their distance.&quot; If this is what Abell assumed, there is little 
point in asking what conclusions he derived. </p>
<p>The fact that the evidence in favor of Hubble's law may be biased does not 
mean that it is untrue; bias may suggest nothing more than a methodological 
flaw. But Segal is persuaded that when the evidence is soberly considered, it 
does contravene accepted doctrine, statistical sloppiness functioning, as it so 
often does, simply to conceal the facts. </p>
<p>A statistical inference is compelling only if the samples upon which it rests 
are objectively compelling. Objectivity, in turn, requires that the process of 
sampling be both reasonably complete and unbiased. Segal and his colleagues have 
taken pains to study samples that within the limits of observation are both. 
Their most recent study contains a detailed parallel analysis of Hubble's law 
across four wave bands, one that essentially surveys all stellar objects within 
each band. The analysis is based on new data drawn from the G. de Vaucoleurs 
survey of bright cluster galaxies, which includes more than 10,000 galaxies. 
Hubble's own analysis, it is worthwhile to recall, was limited to twenty 
galaxies. </p>
<p>The results of their analysis are disturbing. The linear relationship that 
Hubble saw, Segal and his collaborators cannot see and have not found. Rather, 
the relationship between redshift and flux or apparent brightness that they have 
studied in a large number of complete samples satisfies a quadratic law, the 
redshift varying as the square of apparent brightness. &quot;By normal standards of 
scientific due process,&quot; Segal writes, &quot;the results of [Big Bang] cosmology are 
illusory.&quot; </p>
<p>Cosmologists have dismissed Segal's claims with a great snort of indignation. 
But the discrepancy from Big Bang cosmology that they reveal is hardly trivial. 
Like evolutionary biologists, cosmologists are often persuaded that they are in 
command of a structure intellectually powerful enough to accommodate gross 
discrepancies in the data. This is a dangerous and deluded attitude. Hubble's 
law embodies a general hypothesis of Big Bang cosmology--namely, that the 
universe is expanding--and while the law cannot be established by observation, 
observation can establish that it may be false. A statistically responsible body 
of contravening evidence has revealed something more than an incidental defect. 
Indifference to its implications amounts to a decision to place Big Bang 
cosmology beyond rational inquiry. </p>
<p>Monlam Chemno </p>
<p>WHATEVER THE facts may be, the Big Bang is also an event informed by the 
majesty of a great physical theory. Einstein published the equations for general 
relativity in 1915, and more than 80 years later, general relativity remains the 
only theoretical instrument remotely adequate to the representation of the 
universe as a whole. </p>
<p>General relativity is first and fundamentally an account of gravity, the 
force that pulls ballerinas to the ground and that fixes the planets in 
elliptical orbits around the sun. At the beginning of the scientific era, Isaac 
Newton described a universe in which space and time are absolute. The measured 
beating of a great clock is heard, and it is heard everywhere at once. Particles 
move within the unchanging vault of space. Material objects attract one another 
with a force proportional to their mass and inversely proportional to the square 
of the distance between them. </p>
<p>A metaphysical reorganization is required before Newton's caterpillar can 
emerge as Einstein's butterfly. The elements of general relativity are physical 
processes, a word signifying something that starts at one time and at one place 
and that ends at another time and another place, and so crawls along a continuum 
whose intrinsic structure has four dimensions. Within the arena of these 
physical processes, the solid structures of the Newtonian universe undergo a 
dissolution. The great vault of space and the uniformly beating heart dwindle 
and then disappear: this universe is one in which space and time have fused 
themselves into a single entity, and its heart is an ever-changing but 
reciprocating relationship between space-time and matter. Material objects 
direct the space and time that surround them to curve, much as a bowling ball 
deforms the mattress on which it rests; the curvature of space-time determines 
the path undertaken by physical processes, much as an ant crawling on that 
mattress must travel a curved path to get where it is going. </p>
<p>Newtonian gravity acts at a distance and as a force, the very bowels of the 
earth reaching to enfold an object and pull it down. But while Newton was able 
quantitatively to describe how gravity acts, he was unable to say why it acts at 
all, the aching attraction of matter for matter having no other explanation than 
the fact that it is so. General relativity provides an explanation of gravity in 
terms of the curvature of space and time. No forces are involved, and none is 
invoked, but gravity nonetheless emerges in this universe as a natural 
expression of the way the cosmos is constructed. </p>
<p>Freely moving objects, Einstein assumed, follow a path covering the shortest 
distance between points in space and time. Within the ambit of a large material 
object, the shortest distance between such points is curved. Ballerinas 
accelerate toward the center of the earth after being thrown upward by their 
partners because acceleration is required by the geometry in which they are 
embedded. In this fashion, gravity disappears as a force but remains as a fact.
</p>
<p>If the analysis of gravity is at the center of general relativity, the 
intellectual tools responsible for its analysis--the equations that describe the 
ever-changing relationship between curvature and material objects--are 
responsible as well for its local character. For many years, the most precise 
and most interesting tests of the theory were conducted within the narrow 
confines of our own solar system. Cosmology, however, is a global study, one in 
which the universe itself is the object of contemplation, and not any of its 
parts. The conveyance from the local structure of the universe (the sun, the 
solar system) to the universe as a whole must be negotiated by a daring series 
of inferences. </p>
<p>In describing matter on a cosmic scale, cosmologists strip the stars and 
planets, the great galaxies and the bright bursting supernovae, of their 
uniqueness as places and things and replace them with an imaginary distribution: 
the matter of the universe is depicted as a great but uniform and homogeneous 
cloud covering the cosmos equitably in all its secret places. Cosmologists make 
this assumption because they must. There is no way to deal with the universe 
object by object; the equations would be inscrutable, impossible to solve. But 
however useful the assumption of homogeneity may be mathematically, it is false 
in the straightforward sense that the distribution of matter in the universe is 
not homogeneous at all. </p>
<p>Having simplified the contents of the universe, the cosmologist must take 
care as well, and for the same reason, to strip from the matter that remains any 
suggestion of particularity or preference in place. The universe, he must 
assume, is isotropic. It has no center whatsoever, no place toward which things 
tend, and no special direction or axis of coordination. The thing looks much the 
same wherever it is observed. </p>
<p>The twin assumptions that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic are not 
ancillary but indispensable to the hypothesis of an expanding universe; without 
them, no conclusion can mathematically be forthcoming. Together, these two 
assumptions are like the figured bass needed to chant what in Tibetan is known 
as Monlam Chemno, the great prayer to the cosmos. </p>
<p>Specification in the Dark </p>
<p>AN EQUATION draws the noose of an identity between two or more items. The 
field equations of general relativity draw that noose between curvature (the 
metric structure of the universe) and matter (its stress-energy tensor). But it 
is one thing to specify an equation, and quite another to solve it. </p>
<p>The mathematician in him having taken command, Einstein endeavored in 1917 to 
provide cosmological solutions for the field equations of his own theory. He 
struggled with increasing vexation. The models he was able to derive indicated 
that the radius of the universe was either expanding or contracting; it was a 
conclusion that offended his aesthetic sensibilities. By adding a parameter to 
his equations--the so-called cosmological constant --he was in the end able to 
discover a static solution, one that revealed a universe finite in extent, but 
unbounded, like the surface of a sphere. This static solution has a habit of 
dropping from the view of cosmologists, who routinely aver that Einstein's 
theory of general relativity uniquely specifies an expanding universe. Not so.
</p>
<p>Einstein had hoped that the equations of general relativity would determine a 
single world model, or cosmic blueprint. In this he was destined to be 
disappointed. Months after he discovered one solution of the field equations, 
Willem de Sitter discovered another. In de Sitter's universe, there is no matter 
whatsoever, the place looking rather like a dance hall in which the music can be 
heard but no dancers seen, radiation filling the empty spaces and ricocheting 
from one end of creation to another. </p>
<p>In the 1920's, both Aleksandr Friedmann and Georges Lemaitre discovered the 
solutions to the field equations that have dominated cosmology ever since, their 
work coming to amalgamate itself into a single denomination as 
Friedmann-Lemaitre (FL) cosmology. Gone from their models is the cosmological 
constant (although it is resurrected in various inflation scenarios), and as a 
result the universe breathes voluptuously, its radius expanding or contracting 
with time. </p>
<p>FL cosmology does not assign to the universe a unique geometrical identity, 
or specify its fate forever; general relativity is mathematically compatible 
with a number of different physical scenarios. Like the surface of a sphere, the 
universe may well be closed, the whole thing falling back on itself at the end 
of time. A certain symmetry prevails, the life of things and all the drama of 
creation caught between two singularities as the universe traces a trajectory in 
which its initial effervescent explosion is followed by a subsequent enervating 
contraction. </p>
<p>Or yet again, the universe may well be open, space and time forever gushing 
into the void but with ever-decreasing intensity, like an athlete panting in 
shallow breaths. Such a universe is purely a mathematician's world, one seen 
only by the exercise of certain obscure mental muscles, and regarded by 
physicists (and everyone else) with glum distaste. </p>
<p>Or, finally, the universe may be one that occupies the Euclidean space of 
high-school textbooks and intuition alike, balanced precariously but balanced 
forever on a knife's edge between expansion and contraction. </p>
<p>If its predictive capacities seem unstable, FL cosmology has other 
peculiarities as well. Whatever the specific form its solutions take, they are 
alike in assigning dynamic properties to the universe as a whole. The classical 
distinction between the eternal vault of space and time and its entirely 
perishable contents has disappeared. The universe in FL cosmology is itself 
bound to the wheel of being, with space and time no more permanent than water 
and air. Light blazes, the show commences, and like some magnificent but 
mysterious organism, the universe expands with an exuberant rush of energy and 
floods nothingness with the seeds of being. In this fundamental respect, FL 
cosmology breaks both with tradition and with common sense. </p>
<p>At Time Zero </p>
<p>THE INTERPRETATION of a physical theory partakes of a dark art, one in which 
mathematical concepts are ceded dominion over the physical world. In practicing 
this art, the mathematician, like the necromancer that he is, is always liable 
to the temptation of confusing the structures over which he presides with things 
in the real world. </p>
<p>On the assumption--on the assumption--that the universe is expanding, it is 
irresistibly tempting to run time backward until the far-flung debris of the 
cosmos collects itself back into a smaller and smaller area. It seems evident, 
though, that this process of contraction and collapse may be continued only so 
far. An apple may be divided in halves, and then thirds, and then quarters, but 
even though the mathematical sequence of one half, one third, one fourth, and so 
on contains infinitely many terms, and converges ultimately to zero, the apple 
itself may be divided only finitely many times. </p>
<p>This straightforward point has been the source of grave confusion. &quot;The 
universe,&quot; the astronomer Joseph Silk writes, &quot;began at time zero in a state of 
infinite density.&quot; It is there that (by definition) a singularity may be found. 
&quot;Of course,&quot; Silk adds, &quot;the phrase `a state of infinite density' is completely 
unacceptable as a physical description of the universe.... An infinitely dense 
universe [is] where the laws of physics, and even space and time, break down.&quot;
</p>
<p>These are not words that inspire confidence. Does the phrase &quot;a state of 
infinite density&quot; describe a physical state of affairs or not? If it does, the 
description is uninformative by virtue of being &quot;completely unacceptable.&quot; If it 
does not, the description is uninformative by virtue of being completely 
irrelevant. But if the description is either unacceptable or irrelevant, what 
reason is there to believe that the universe began in an initial singularity? 
Absent an initial singularity, what reason is there to believe that the universe 
began at all? </p>
<p>When prominent cosmologists tie themselves in knots, charity tends to assign 
the blame to the medium in which they are navigating--books for a general 
audience--rather than the message they are conveying. But when it comes to the 
singularities, the knots form in every medium, evidence that the message is at 
fault and not the other way around. Cosmologists often claim that the 
mathematicians among them have demonstrated what they themselves may be unable 
clearly to express. In a passage that is typical, the astrophysicist Kip Thorne 
writes that &quot;[Stephen] Hawking and [Roger] Penrose in 1970 proved--without any 
idealizing assumptions--that our universe must have had a space-time singularity 
at the beginning of its Big Bang expansion.&quot; But while it is true that Hawking 
and Penrose proved something, what they demonstrated remains within the gerbil 
wheel of mathematics; any additional inference requires a connection that the 
mathematician is not in a position to provide. </p>
<p>The concept of a singularity belongs essentially to mathematics. 
Singularities are not experimentally accessible objects. They cannot be weighed, 
measured, assessed, replicated, balanced, or seen by any modality of the senses. 
Within certain mathematical contexts, the concept has real content. An ordinary 
curve goes up one side of the blackboard and down the other; it changes its 
direction at a singular point. There are singularities within the calculus, and 
singularities in complex function theory where imaginary numbers loiter, and 
singularities in the space of smooth maps. There are singularities within 
general relativity as well, but the term covers a variety of cases, and the 
singularities within general relativity are distinctly odd. </p>
<p>In most mathematical theories a natural distinction is drawn between a figure 
and its background: a curve arcs within the broader ambit of an enveloping 
space, a mapping is easily distinguished from the spaces it connects. Typically, 
it is the figure that admits of a singularity: the curve changes its direction 
or the mapping breaks down, while the background stays the same. But in general 
relativity, it is the background that suffers a singularity, the very fabric of 
space and time giving way with a rip as curvature zooms off to infinity and 
space and time contort themselves. For the purposes of describing such 
singularities, the usual mathematical techniques are unavailing. </p>
<p>That having been said, here is what Hawking and Penrose brought under the 
control of a mathematical demonstration. The setting is FL cosmology and only FL 
cosmology. There are three kinds of universe to consider, and innumerably many 
species within each type. Those that are open and forever gushing into the void 
are called hyperbolic. Within almost all of those hyperbolic universes, almost 
all processes begin at a point in the past. Within the two types of universe 
that remain, there is bound to be at least one process that has begun somewhere 
in the past. </p>
<p>Despite the tics--&quot;almost all,&quot; &quot;at least one&quot; --the Penrose-Hawking theorems 
do indeed demonstrate that some universes begin in an initial singularity. But 
the light thrown by the Penrose-Hawking theorems flickers over a mathematical 
theory and so a mathematical universe. The universe that we inhabit is a 
physical system. Nothing but grief can come of confusing the one for the other. 
FL cosmology requires the existence of space-time singularities, but there is 
nothing in the Penrose-Hawking theorems to suggest that a space-time singularity 
corresponds to an explosion, or marks the beginning of an expansion, or 
describes an accessible portion of space and time, or connects itself to any 
physical state of affairs whatsoever. </p>
<p>Mathematical concepts achieve physical significance only when the theories in 
which they are embedded are confirmed by experience. If a space-time singularity 
is not a physical event, no such confirmation can logically be forthcoming. With 
the argument rolled backward, it follows that if these mathematical theories are 
not confirmed by experience, then neither have they achieved any physical 
significance. </p>
<p>It is Einstein who expressed the most reasonable and deeply thought views on 
this matter. &quot;One may not therefore assume the validity of the [field] equation 
for very high density of the field and of matter,&quot; he remarked, &quot;and one may not 
conclude that the beginning of the expansion must mean a singularity in the 
mathematical sense. All we have to realize is that the equations may not be 
continued over such regions.&quot; </p>
<p>The sharp, clean, bracing light that the Big Bang was to have thrown on the 
very origins of space and time lapses when it is most needed. The relevant 
equations of general relativity fall silent at precisely the moment we most wish 
they would speak. </p>
<p>The Closing Circle </p>
<p>LIKE SO many haunting human stories, the scientific story of the Big Bang is 
circular in the progression of its ideas and circular thus in its deepest 
nature. Cosmologists have routinely assumed that the universe is expanding 
because they have been persuaded of FL cosmology; and they have been persuaded 
of FL cosmology because they have routinely assumed that the universe is 
expanding. The pattern would be intellectually convenient if it were 
intellectually compelling. </p>
<p>If the evidence in favor of Big Bang cosmology is more suspect than generally 
imagined, its defects are far stronger than generally credited. Whatever else it 
may be, the universe is a bright, noisy, energetic place. There are monstrously 
large galaxies in the skies and countlessly many suns burning with fierce 
thermonuclear fires. Black holes are said to loiter here and there, sucking in 
matter and light and releasing it slowly in the form of radiation. Whence the 
energy for the show, the place where accounts are settled? The principles of 
19th-century physics require that, in one way or another, accounts must be 
settled. Energy is neither created nor destroyed. </p>
<p>Hot Big Bang cosmology appears to be in violation of the first law of 
thermodynamics. The global energy needed to run the universe has come from 
nowhere, and to nowhere it apparently goes as the universe loses energy by 
cooling itself. </p>
<p>This contravention of thermodynamics expresses, in physical form, a general 
philosophical anxiety. Having brought space and time into existence, along with 
everything else, the Big Bang itself remains outside any causal scheme. The 
creation of the universe remains unexplained by any force, field, power, 
potency, influence, or instrumentality known to physics--or to man. The whole 
vast imposing structure organizes itself from absolutely nothing. </p>
<p>This is not simply difficult to grasp. It is incomprehensible. </p>
<p>Physicists, no less than anyone else, are uneasy with the idea that the 
universe simply popped into existence, with space and time &quot;suddenly switching 
themselves on.&quot; The image of a light switch comes from Paul Davies, who uses it 
to express a miracle without quite recognizing that it embodies a contradiction. 
A universe that has suddenly switched itself on has accomplished something 
within time; and yet the Big Bang is supposed to have brought space and time 
into existence. </p>
<p>Having entered a dark logical defile, physicists often find it difficult to 
withdraw. Thus, Alan Guth writes in pleased astonishment that the universe 
really did arise from &quot;essentially . . . nothing at all&quot;: as it happens, a false 
vacuum patch &quot;[10.sup.-26] centimeters in diameter&quot; and &quot;[10.sup.-32] solar 
masses.&quot; It would appear, then, that &quot;essentially nothing&quot; has both spatial 
extension and mass. While these facts may strike Guth as inconspicuous, others 
may suspect that nothingness, like death, is not a matter that admits of 
degrees. </p>
<p>The attempt to discover some primordial stuff that can be described both as 
nothing and as something recalls the Maori contemplating the manifold mysteries 
of pot This apparently gives Stephen Hawking pause. &quot;To ask what happened before 
the universe began,&quot; he has written, &quot;is like asking for a point on the Earth at 
91 degrees north latitude.&quot; We are on the inside of the great sphere of space 
and time, and while we can see to the boundaries, there is nothing beyond to see 
if only because there is nothing beyond. &quot;Instead of talking about the universe 
being created, and maybe coming to an end,&quot; Hawking writes, &quot;one should just 
say: the universe is.&quot; </p>
<p>Now this is a conclusion to which mystics have always given their assent; but 
having concluded that the universe just &quot;is,&quot; cosmologists, one might think, 
would wish to know why it is. The question that Hawking wishes to evade 
disappears as a question m physics only to reappear as a question m philosophy; 
we find ourselves traveling in all the old familiar circles. </p>
<p>Contract </p>
<p>STANDING AT the gate of modern time, Isaac Newton forged the curious social 
pact by which rational men and women have lived ever since. The description of 
the physical world would be vouchsafed to a particular institution, that of 
mathematical physics; and it was to the physicists and not the priests, 
soothsayers, poets, politicians, novelists, generals, mystics, artists, 
astrologers, warlocks, wizards, or enchanters that society would look for 
judgments about the nature of the physical world. If knowledge is power, the 
physicists have, by this arrangement, been given an enormous privilege. But a 
social arrangement is among other things a contract: something is given, but 
something is expected as well. In exchange for their privilege, the physicists 
were to provide an account of the physical world at once penetrating, general, 
persuasive, and true. </p>
<p>Until recently, the great physicists have been scrupulous about honoring the 
terms of their contract. They have attempted with dignity to respect the 
distinction between what is known and what is not. Even quantum electrodynamics, 
the most successful theory ever devised, was described honestly by its founder, 
Richard Feynman, as resting on a number of unwholesome mathematical tricks. </p>
<p>This scrupulousness has lately been compromised. The result has been the 
calculated or careless erasure of the line separating disciplined physical 
inquiry from speculative metaphysics. Contemporary cosmologists feel free to say 
anything that pops into their heads. Unhappy examples are everywhere: absurd 
schemes to model time on the basis of the complex numbers, as in Stephen 
Hawking's A Brief History of Time; bizarre and ugly contraptions for cosmic 
inflation; universes multiplying beyond the reach of observation; white holes, 
black holes, worm holes, and naked singularities; theories of every stripe and 
variety, all of them uncorrected by any criticism beyond the trivial. </p>
<p>The physicists carry on endlessly because they can. Just recently, for 
example, Lee Smolin, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania, has 
offered a Darwinian interpretation of cosmology, a theory of &quot;cosmological 
natural selection.&quot; On Smolin's view, the Big Bang happened within a black hole; 
new universes are bubbling up all the time, each emerging from its own black 
hole and each provided with its own set of physical laws, so that the very 
concept of a law of nature is shown to be a part of the mutability of things.
</p>
<p>There is, needless to say, no evidence whatsoever in favor of this 
preposterous theory. The universes that are bubbling up are unobservable. So, 
too, are the universes that have bubbled up and those that will bubble up in the 
future. Smolin's theories cannot be confirmed by experience. Or by anything 
else. What law of nature could reveal that the laws of nature are contingent? 
Yet the fact that when Smolin's theory is self-applied it self-destructs has not 
prevented physicists like Alan Guth, Roger Penrose, and Martin Rees from 
circumspectly applauding the effort nonetheless. </p>
<p>A scientific crisis has historically been the excuse to which scientists have 
appealed for the exculpation of damaged doctrines. Smolin is no exception. &quot;We 
are living,&quot; he writes, &quot;through a period of scientific crisis.&quot; Ordinary men 
and women may well scruple at the idea that cosmology is in crisis because 
cosmologists, deep down, have run out of interesting things to say, but in his 
general suspicions Smolin is no doubt correct. What we are discovering is that 
many areas of the universe are apparently protected from our scrutiny, like 
sensitive files sealed from view by powerful encryption codes. However painful, 
the discovery should hardly be unexpected. Beyond every act of understanding, 
there is an abyss. </p>
<p>Like Darwin's theory of evolution, Big Bang cosmology has undergone that 
curious social process in which a scientific theory is promoted to a secular 
myth. The two theories serve as points of certainty in an intellectual culture 
that is otherwise disposed to give the benefit of the doubt to doubt itself. It 
is within the mirror of these myths that we have come to see ourselves. But if 
the promotion of theory into myth satisfies one human agenda, it violates 
another. Myths are quite typically false, and science is concerned with truth. 
Human beings, it would seem, may make scientific theories or they may make 
myths, but with respect to the same aspects of experience, they cannot quite do 
both. </p>
