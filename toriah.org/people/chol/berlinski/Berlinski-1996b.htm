<p>The theory of evolution is the great white elephant of contemporary thought. 
It is large, almost entirely useless, and the object of superstitious awe. 
Richard Dawkins is widely known as the theory's uncompromising champion. Having 
made his case in <i>The Blind Watchmaker</i> and <i>River out of Eden</i>, 
Dawkins proposes to make it yet again in<i> Climbing Mount Improbable</i>. He is 
not a man given to tiring himself by repetition. </p>
<p>Darwin's theory has a double aspect. The first is the doctrine of descent 
with modification; the second, the doctrine of random variation and natural 
selection. Descent with modification provides the pattern; random variation and 
natural selection, the mechanism. Dawkins' concern is with the mechanism; the 
pattern he takes for granted. </p>
<p>Biological structures such as the mammalian eye are complex in the sense that 
they contain many parts arranged in specific ways. It is unlikely that such 
structures could have been discovered by chance. No one, the astrophysicist N. 
C. Wickramasinghe once observed with some asperity, expects a tornado touching 
on a junkyard to produce a Boeing 747. This may suggest---it <i>has</i> 
suggested to some physicists---a disturbing gap between what life has 
accomplished and what the theory of evolution can explain. The suggestion 
provokes Dawkins to indignation. &quot;It is grindingly, creakingly, crashingly 
obvious,&quot; he writes, mixing three metaphors joyously, that the discovery by 
chance of a complex object is improbable; but the Darwinian mechanism, he adds, 
&quot;acts by breaking the improbability up into small manageable parts, smearing out 
the luck needed, going round the back of Mount Improbable and crawling up the 
gentle slopes....&quot; </p>
<p>This is a fine image, one introduced originally by the American 
bio-mathematician Sewell Wright. Random variation offers the mountaineer an 
allowance of small changes. Chance is at work. Natural selection freezes the 
successful changes in place. And this process owes nothing to chance. In time, 
the successful changes form a connected path, a staircase to complexity. </p>
<p>The example that Dawkins pursues in greatest detail is the eye. Darwin 
himself wondered at its complexity, remarking in a letter to an American 
colleague that &quot;the eye...gives me a cold shudder.&quot; That shudder 
notwithstanding, Darwin resolved his doubts in his own favor; the eye, he 
concluded, was created by a single-step series of improvements, what he called 
'fine gradations.' Where Darwin went, Dawkins follows. </p>
<p>It is one thing, however, to appeal to a path up Mount Improbable, quite 
another to demonstrate its existence. Dawkins has persuaded himself that because 
such a path might exist, further argument is unnecessary. Impediments are simply 
directed to disappear: &quot;There is no difficulty&quot;; &quot;there is a definite tendency 
in the right direction&quot;; &quot;It is easy to see that...&quot;; &quot;it is not at all 
difficult to imagine....&quot; </p>
<p>In fact, the difficulties are very considerable. A single retinal cell of the 
human eye consists of a nucleus, a mitochondrial rod, and a rectangular array 
containing discrete layers of photon-trapping pigment. The evolutionary 
development of the eye evidently required an increase in such layers. An 
inferential staircase being required, the thing virtually constructs itself, 
Dawkins believes, one layer at a time. &quot;The point,&quot; he writes, &quot;is that 
ninety-one membranes are more effective...than ninety, ninety are more effective 
that eighty-nine, and so on back to one membrane, which is more effective than 
zero.&quot; </p>
<p>This is a plausible scheme only because Dawkins has considered a single 
feature of the eye in isolation. The parts of a complex artifact or object 
typically gain their usefulness as an ensemble. A Dixie Cup consists of a tube 
joined to a disk. Without the disk, the cup does not hold less water than it 
might; it cannot hold water at all. And ditto for the tube, the two items, disk 
and tube, forming an irreducibly complex system. </p>
<p>What holds for the Dixie Cup holds for the eye as well. Light strikes the eye 
in the form of photons, but the optic nerve conveys electrical impulses to the 
brain. Acting as a sophisticated transducer, the eye must mediate between two 
different physical signals. The retinal cells that figure in Dawkins' account 
are connected to horizontal cells; these shuttle information laterally between 
photoreceptors in order to smooth the visual signal. Amacrine cells act to 
filter the signal. Bipolar cells convey visual information further to ganglion 
cells, which in turn conduct information to the optic nerve. The system gives 
every indication of being tightly integrated, its parts mutually dependent. </p>
<p>The very problem that Darwin's theory was designed to evade now reappears. 
Like vibrations passing through a spider's web, changes to any part of the eye, 
if they are to improve vision, must bring about changes throughout the optical 
system. Without a correlative increase in the size and complexity of the optic 
nerve, an increase in the number of photoreceptive membranes can have no effect. 
A change in the optic nerve must in turn induce corresponding neurological 
changes in the brain. If these changes come about simultaneously, it makes no 
sense to talk of a gradual ascent of Mount Improbable. If they do not come about 
simultaneously, it is not clear why they should come about at all. </p>
<p>The same problem reappears at the level of biochemistry. Dawkins has framed 
his discussion in terms of gross anatomy. Each anatomical change that he 
describes requires a number of coordinate biochemical steps. &quot;[T]he anatomical 
steps and structures that Darwin thought were so simple,&quot; the biochemist Mike 
Behe remarks in a provocative new book (<i>Darwin's Black Box</i>), &quot;actually 
involve staggeringly complicated biochemical processes.&quot; A number of separate 
biochemical events are required simply to begin the process of curving a layer 
of proteins to form a lens. What initiates the sequence? How is it coordinated? 
And how controlled? On these absolutely fundamental matters, Dawkins has nothing 
whatsoever to say. </p>
<p>In addition to the eye, Dawkins discusses spiders and their webs, the origin 
of flight, and the nature of seashells. The natural history is charming. </p>
<p>Dawkins is a capable if somewhat dry prose stylist, although such expressions 
as 'designoid' and 'wince-makingly' are themselves wince-making. The science 
throughout is primitive. Difficulties are resolved by sleight-of-hand. &quot;In real 
life,&quot; Dawkins remarks in a representative passage, &quot;there may be formidable 
complications of detail.&quot; Yes? What of them, those formidable complications? 
&quot;These emerge simply and without fuss.&quot; </p>
<p>Is the elephant's large nose truly the result of an evolutionary progression? 
Then some demonstration is required showing that intermediate-sized noses are 
valuable as well. None is forthcoming. &quot;If a medium sized trunk were always less 
efficient,&quot; Dawkins writes, &quot;than either a small nose or a big trunk, the big 
trunk would never have evolved.&quot; Indeed. The emergence of powered flight is 
treated as an engaging fable, one in which either arboreal animals glided 
downward from the tree tops or a primitive dinosaur hopped upward toward the 
sky. &quot;The beauty of this theory,&quot; Dawkins affirms, commending the hopping 
scenario, &quot;is that the same nervous circuits that were used to control the 
center of gravity in the jumping ancestor would, rather effortlessly, have lent 
themselves to controlling the flight surfaces later in the evolutionary story.&quot; 
It is the phrase &quot;rather effortlessly&quot; that gives to this preposterous assertion 
its antic charm. </p>
<p>A final note. In a book whose examples are chosen from natural history, it is 
important to get the details right. Hawks may soar or sail, but they cannot 
hover like helicopters. Not all organisms share precisely the same genetic code. 
And Gary Kasparov was defeated by IBM's Big Blue, and not a program entitled 
Genius 2. </p>
