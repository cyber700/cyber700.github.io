	</span><strong>from 10,000 years to less than 2,000 years</strong>.&nbsp; 
	According to a news item on Space.com, the object RCW 86 in Centaurus has 
	been linked to sightings by the Chinese in 185 of the Common Era, making it 
	the oldest supernova recorded by man, taking place 1821 years ago. 
	Astronomers dated this supernova remnant to 10,000 years old.&nbsp; But how could 
	the earlier age estimates be so far off?&nbsp; The article explains: </font>
	</span><font size="2" face="Verdana">I</font></ul>
<p align="justify" class="style14">Shell shocked: In the Astrological Annals of 
the Houhanshu, Chinese astronomers noted the bright light in the sky twinkled 
like a star but didn’t appear to move, arguing against the object being a comet. 
Within eight months, they recorded, the bright light faded, a phenomenon that 
astronomers now know is consistent with supernovas. ...</p>
<p align="justify" class="style14">Astronomers had suggested the stellar 
material called RCW 86 could be leftovers from the 185 AD supernova, based on 
historical records of the object’s position in the sky. <strong>But previous 
work estimated the object was 10,000 years old</strong>, which led to doubts 
about the link. ...</p>
<p align="justify" class="style11"><font size="2">Astronomers led by Vink 
studied the material in RCW 86 to determine when its progenitor star originally 
exploded within the Southern Hemisphere constellation Centaurus. To do this, 
they used the X-ray capabilities of NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and the 
European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton Observatory. <br>
<br>
RCW 86 is encased in an expanding shock wave formed during its transit from the 
original explosion. By peering into one part of RCW 86, the astronomers 
calculated how fast this cosmic bubble was moving. So with the size and speed of 
RCW 86, the astronomers could calculate the time of the explosion, and hence the 
remnant’s age. <br>
<br>
“<strong>Our new calculations tell us the remnant is about 2,000 years old</strong>,” 
said Aya Bamba, a coauthor from the Institute of Physical and Chemical 
Researcher in Japan. <br>
<br>
Youthful star: The new age estimate matches the supernova spotted [by the 
Chinese] in 185 AD. But this calculation means the remnant is 8,000 years 
younger than previously thought. The astronomers said the difference can be 
attributed to the irregular shape of the remnant’s expanding bubble. Stellar 
wind from the progenitor star pushed some of the remnant’s gases in a certain 
direction, forming a dense pile. “The idea for RCW 86 is that in some regions 
the shock has hit this piled-up material. In those regions the shock will start 
moving slower,” Vink said. And in other regions, the shock wave is much 
speedier. <br>
<br>
“This could explain the earlier measurements for lower shock velocities,” Vink 
told SPACE.com. The previous speeds were used to calculate RCW 86’s age. <br>
<br>

<p align="justify" class="style13"><font size="2">In the case of RCW 86, we had 
the Chinese observation during historical times to calibrate the dating method. 
The calibrated result was substantially lower than predicted from theory. But, 
what about all those dating methods that depend on open-ended extrapolations 
that cannot be so calibrated by empirical observations?</font></p>

	Over the past few years, researchers have detected several galaxies that 
	were surprisingly massive, given that their measured distance puts them in 
	the early universe (SN: 3/1/03, p. 139). Two of the galaxies, recently found 
	by Andrew Bunker of the University of Exeter in England and his colleagues, 
	are less than a billion years old, which is less than 5 percent of the age 
	of the universe. Despite their youth, these galaxies contain stars that 
	formed at least 100 million years earlier in time. Furthermore, the galaxies 
	are at least 20 percent as massive as today's typical bright galaxy, which 
	took some 12 billion years to pack on that material. The team reports 
	several of its findings in an upcoming Monthly Notices of the Royal 
	Astronomical Society. ...</font><p align="justify" class="style9">In a 
	report on Sept. 27, Mobasher and his colleagues describe what appears to be
	<strong>an even more outlandish result</strong>. They have evidence of a 
	true whopper of a galaxy-perhaps the most massive ever detected from the 
	early universe. Observations taken at several visible-light and infrared 
	wavelengths suggest that it's likely to be one of the earliest galaxies ever 
	found. It appears to reside 13 billion light-years from Earth. So, the light 
	now reaching our planet left the galaxy when the cosmos was about 800 
	million years old. Mobasher's group estimates that the galaxy is six times 
	as massive as the Milky Way. Moreover, t<strong>he reddish tinge of the 
	galaxy's stars indicates that they're quite mature and must have formed 
	about 200 hundred million years farther back in time</strong>.&nbsp;

	13.7 billion years old.<p align="justify" class="style9">This means that not

	Like his illustrious grandfather Julian Huxley became a major spokesperson 
	for Darwinism when in 1942 he published his “Evolution: The Modern

	evolutionists like Huxley] wholeheartedly subscribed to Lyell’s 
	Uniformitarian Doctrine; namely, that the forces we now see shaping the 
	world are the same forces that have operated in the past. While that is what 
	most geologists still accept there is no <i>a priori</i> justification for 
	extending that concept to the living world [it does not work in geology 
	either]. That is what makes the following quotes all the more significant.

	in the literature which do not have a plausible scientific explanation. 
	Discrepancies frequently appear when different teams of geologists date the 
	same ancient geological formation involving different dating methods. Some 
	of the world’s top scientists held a workshop sponsored by the National 
	Science Foundation to address some of these problems. The October 17, 2003

	Natural History, geochronologists declared that they must do better, much 
	better, and called for an unprecedented effort to calibrate the geologic 
	time scale. ... &quot;We need a major international cooperative network of 
	geochronology centers dedicated to the goal of science-driven, integrative 
	calibration,&quot; said Samuel Bowring of the Massachusetts Institute of

	notes, participants agreed that &quot;we have to make sure we’re all getting the 
	same answer on the same rocks.&quot; <b>That doesn't always happen</b>.</i>” ...<br>
	<br>One example of this is the attempted dating of the Latemar limestone belt in 
	northern Italy’s Dolomite Mountains. Scientists have been trying to find out 
	how long it took microscopic carbonate skeletons to pile up on the ancient 
	seafloor to form this 600-meter layer. Science reported (see also Science, 
	12 November 1999, <a href="../articles/kerr-1999.pdf">p. 1279</a>): <br><br>“<i>Other crucial ages are also out of whack. ... Assuming that the distinctive layers of the Latemar matched climate 
	cycles driven by clocklike variations in the shape of Earth’s orbit, 
	sedimentologists estimated that it took about 8 million years to form the 
	whole pile. Uranium-lead dating of zircons from volcanic ash beds in the 
	Latemar, however, produced a figure of about 2 million years — too little 
	time to form such deposits, sedimentologists say. <b>Years of work on both 
	ways of dating the Latemar have failed to resolve the conflict</b>”.<br><br>
	</i>&quot;<i>In addition to more dating, researchers want better dating. 
	Long-recognized problems with standards, interlab calibration, and sample

	and argon-argon radiometric dating. At the moment, these two leading 
	techniques <b>consistently differ </b>on the age of the same sample by 1%</i>&quot;<br>
	<br>The article makes the following interesting statement:<i> “<b>The general 
	sparseness of reliable ages was the primary complaint at the workshop</b></i>&quot;. 
	Given that there are tens of thousands of dates reported in the literature, 
	one wonders why reliable dates are sparse. Do geologists know something 
	about discordances that we laypeople do not? One wonders how many results 
	are never reported and filed away for later study because of inconsistencies.

	leading candidates, is in trouble. A growing number of physicists claim it

	universe, the theory describes 10^500, each with different constants of 
	nature, even different laws of physics ... &quot;. In the interview Susskind is 
	asked: &quot;If we do not accept the landscape idea are we stuck with intelligent 
	design?&quot;. He answers: &quot;I doubt that physicists will see it that way. If, for 
	some unforeseen reason, the landscape turns out to be inconsistent - maybe 
	for mathematical reasons, or because it disagrees with observation - I am 
	pretty sure that physicists will go on searching for natural explanations of 
	the world. <b>But I have to say that if that happens, as things stand now we 
	will be in a very awkward position. Without any explanation of nature's

	of radioactivity. The puzzling phenomenon threatened even the laws of

	exponentially. <i>String theorists watched with horror as a stupendous 
	Landscape opened up with so many valleys that almost anything can be found 
	somewhere in it</i>. The theory also exhibited a nasty tendency to produce 
	Rube Goldberg machines. In searching the Landscape for the Standard Model, 
	the constructions became unpleasantly complicated. More and more “moving 
	parts” had to be introduced to account for all the requirements, and by now 
	it seems that no realistic model would pass muster with the American Society 
	of Engineers — not for elegance in any case.&quot; Woit quotes the cosmologist 
	George Ellis, writing recently recently in Nature that: &quot;Physicists [such as 
	Susskind] indulging in this kind of <b>speculation</b> sometimes denigrate 
	philosophers of science, but they themselves do not yet have rigorous 
	criteria to offer for proof of physical existence. This is what is needed to 
	make this area solid science, rather than <b>speculation</b>. Until then,

			LEDs cannot escape, resulting in what scientists call a low 
			extraction efficiency of light. The LED developed at MIT [in 2001] 
			used a two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal - a triangular lattice 
			of holes etched into the LED's upper cladding layer - to enhance the 
			extraction of light. And layered structures called Bragg reflectors 
			were used to control the emission direction. These high emission 
			devices potentially offer a <i>huge</i> step up in performance over

			for signalling to each other in the wild.&quot; Dr Vukosic stated that 
			&quot;Unlike the diodes, the butterfly's system clearly doesn't have 
			semiconductors in it and it doesn't produce its own radiative 
			energy. That makes it <i>doubly efficient</i> in a way. But the way 
			light is extracted from the butterfly's system is more than an 
			analogy - it's all but identical in <b>design</b> to the LED.&quot;&nbsp; 
			Dr Vukusic agreed that studying natural designs such as this <i>could help scientists improve upon manmade devices.</i> [Italics not

	<i>Altruism</i>: On November the 5th, 2005, in Toronto, a grandmother 
	Rosalia DeSantis was travelling home from her job when she felt hot and 
	dizzy, and she leaned over the edge of the platform at Lawrence West 
	Station, to see if a train was on the way. She fainted, hit her head, fell 
	into the gap, and was lying across a track bleeding, with a train seconds 
	away. How did she survive? Two men who knew neither her nor each other - 
	Theo Parusis, 25, and Alvaro Meija, 26 - jumped down onto the track and 
	hoisted her up to safety, five seconds before the train rolled over the 
	spot. To most of us, these guys are heroes. But, as pointed out by 
	post-Darwinist Denyse O'Leary, they are considered by evolutionary 
	psychologists to be &quot;the last remaining unsolved problem in evolution&quot; 
	[Gabriel Dover, &quot;Anti-Dawkins&quot; in Rose, Hilary and Steven Rose, <i>Alas, 
	Poor Darwin: Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology</i>, London, Random 
	House Vintage, 2001, p. 48]. Why are these guys a problem? Because according 
	to evolutionary psychology, human beings are simply evolved animals, and 
	animals do not do things like that. For example, in a recent letter to 
	science journal Nature, researchers revealed that chimpanzees will not help 
	other chimps unless they know them, even if helping would cost nothing, 
	never mind that it might entail a risk. So if chimps don't do it, people 
	cannot really be doing it either. So, evolutionists are forced into a 
	variety of ingenious suggestions that the young men's behaviour was really 
	selfish at heart. The Nature article reference and abstract is:<br><br><i>Chimpanzees are indifferent to the welfare of unrelated group members</i><br>
	<i>Nature 437, 1357-1359 (27 October 2005)<br></i>Joan B. Silk, Sarah F. Brosnan, Jennifer Vonk, Joseph Henrich, Daniel J. 
	Povinelli, Amanda S. Richardson, Susan P. Lambeth, Jenny Mascaro and Steven 
	J. Schapiro.<br>&nbsp;<br>Humans are an unusually prosocial species - we vote, give blood, recycle, 
	give tithes and punish violators of social norms. Experimental evidence 
	indicates that people willingly incur costs to help strangers in anonymous 
	one-shot interactions, and that altruistic behaviour is motivated, at least 
	in part, by empathy and concern for the welfare of others (hereafter 
	referred to as other-regarding preferences). In contrast, cooperative 
	behaviour in non-human primates is mainly limited to kin and reciprocating 
	partners, and is virtually never extended to unfamiliar individuals. Here we 
	present experimental tests of the existence of other-regarding preferences 
	in non-human primates, and show that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) do not 
	take advantage of opportunities to deliver benefits to familiar individuals 
	at no material cost to themselves, suggesting that chimpanzee behaviour is 
	not motivated by other-regarding preferences. Chimpanzees are among the 
	primates most likely to demonstrate prosocial behaviours. They participate 
	in a variety of collective activities, including territorial patrols, 
	coalitionary aggression, cooperative hunting, food sharing and joint mate 
	guarding. Consolation of victims of aggression and anecdotal accounts of 
	solicitous treatment of injured individuals suggest that chimpanzees may 
	feel empathy. Chimpanzees sometimes reject exchanges in which they receive 
	less valuable rewards than others, which may be one element of a 'sense of 
	fairness', but there is no evidence that they are averse to interactions in 
	which they benefit more than others. <br><br><i>Editor's Summary, 27 October 2005 Law of the jungle:</i><br>There is plenty of evidence - some of it cited in this week's Review Article 
	- that humans care about the welfare of others and will provide costly 
	assistance even to strangers. Frans de Waal has argued that 'other-regarding 
	sentiments' may be deep-rooted in primate evolutionary history. But a test 
	for such behaviour in chimpanzees has drawn a blank. They spurn the chance 
	to deliver benefits to unrelated but familiar individuals at no cost to 
	themselves, cooperating only with their kin and partners.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>

	The Torah often speaks of the heart as the seat of intellect and emotion: 
	“God saw that the wickedness of Man was great upon the earth, and that every 
	product of his <i>heart</i> was but evil always. And God reconsidered having 
	made Man on earth, and He had heartfelt sadness&quot;. (Gen 6:5). This is thought 
	to be thoroughly unscientific, since the heart is viewed as a purely 
	mechanical pump. However, as reported in a book review (in the science 
	magazine <i><a href="../articles/burdick-2004.pdf">Discover</a> 2004) </i>of 
	essayist Charles Siebert's new book:<br>... the heart is no mere pump, as some physicians still insist, but a 
	sophisticated participant in the regulation of emotion. The heart has a mind 
	of its own: It secretes its own brain-like hormones and actively partakes in 
	a dialogue among the internal organs, a dialogue on which cardiac 
	researchers are only beginning to eavesdrop. The heart likewise undergoes 
	all manner of organic change inflicted on it by the tempestuous brain and 
	its neurochemicals. As one doctor explains, people do suffer heartbreak, 
	literally ... Consider the fate of William Schroeder, the second—and 
	longest-surviving—recipient, in 1984, of the Jarvik-7 artificial heart. As a 
	pump, the Jarvik-7 was a resounding success, keeping Schroeder alive for an 
	unprecedented 620 days. The patient’s mental state was another matter. 
	Schroeder was weepy and deeply despondent. (Barney Clark, the first Jarvik-7 
	recipient, expressed a wish to die or be killed.) The blood still 
	circulated, but something vital—some emotionally charged communication 
	between heart and mind—had been lost. What is it like, Siebert asks, to 
	watch your favorite sports team rally yet not feel your pulse quicken? To 
	see a loved one yet not feel your heart leap? “When someone’s heart is no 
	longer working in concert with those feelings, does he feel that and cry 
	more?” Affirming all myths, the heart truly is a seat of human emotion. The 
	Jarvik-7, in contrast, was deaf to the song of human experience; built to 
	invigorate its patient, it instead alienated him, supplying Schroeder with 
	everything but the will to live. He had the look, Siebert writes, “of a man 
	who has lost his heart&quot;.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>

	Mishna in Tractate Baba Metzia &quot;caused economists and mathematicians around

	Evolutionists keep insisting that evolution is a fact beyond any rational

	they do not admit to any difficulties until they find a new paradigm. The
