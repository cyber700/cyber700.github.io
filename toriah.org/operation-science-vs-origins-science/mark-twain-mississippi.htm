		<font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #9999ff">Twain</font>, <i>Life on the 
		Mississippi</i> 173-6 (1883).</p>
		<p><strong>(Or the Dangers of Extrapolation :-)</strong></p>
		<p>One of the Mississippi's oddest peculiarities is that of shortening 
		its length from time to time. If you will throw a long, pliant 
		apple-paring over your shoulder, it will pretty fairly shape itself into 
		an average section of the Mississippi River; that is, the nine or ten 
		hundred miles stretching from Cairo, Illinois, southward to New Orleans, 
		the same being wonderfully crooked, with a brief straight bit here and 
		there at wide intervals. The two-hundred-mile stretch from Cairo 
		northward to St. Louis is by no means so crooked, that being a rocky 
		country which the river cannot cut much. </p>
		<p>The water cuts the alluvial banks of the `lower' river into deep 
		horseshoe curves; so deep, indeed, that in some places if you were to 
		get ashore at one extremity of the horseshoe and walk across the neck, 
		half or three quarters of a mile, you could sit down and rest a couple 
		of hours while your steamer was coming around the long elbow, at a speed 
		of ten miles an hour, to take you aboard again. When the river is rising 
		fast, some scoundrel whose plantation is back in the country, and 
		therefore of inferior value, has only to watch his chance, cut a little 
		gutter across the narrow neck of land some dark night, and turn the 
		water into it, and in a wonderfully short time a miracle has happened: 
		to wit, the whole Mississippi has taken possession of that little ditch, 
		and placed the countryman's plantation on its bank. </p>
		<p>Pray observe some of the effects of this ditching business. The 
		Mississippi between Cairo and New Orleans was twelve hundred and fifteen 
		miles long one hundred and seventy-six years ago. It was eleven hundred 
		and eighty after the cut-off of 1722. It was one thousand and forty 
		after the American Bend cut-off. It has lost sixty-seven miles since. 
		Consequently its length is only nine hundred and seventy-three miles at 
		present. </p>
		<p>Now, if I wanted to be one of those ponderous scientific people, and 
		&quot;let on&quot; to prove what had occurred in the remote past by what had 
		occurred in a given time in the recent past, or what will occur in the 
		far future by what has occurred in late years, what an opportunity is 
		here! Geology never had such a chance, nor such exact data to argue 
		from! Nor &quot;development of species&quot;, either! Glacial epochs are great 
		things, but they are vague--vague. Please observe. <strong>In the space of one 
		hundred and seventy-six years the Lower Mississippi has shortened itself 
		two hundred and forty-two miles. This is an average of a trifle over one 
		mile and a third per year. Therefore, any calm person, who is not blind 
		or idiotic, can see that in the Old Oolitic Silurian Period, just a 
		million years ago next November, the Lower Mississippi River was upward 
		of one million three hundred thousand miles long, and stuck out over the 
		Gulf of Mexico like a fishing-rod.</strong> And by the same token any person can 
		see that seven hundred and forty-two years from now the Lower 
		Mississippi will be only a mile and three-quarters long, and Cairo and 
		New Orleans will have joined their streets together, and be plodding 
		comfortably along under a single mayor and a mutual board of aldermen. 
		There is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale 
		returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.
