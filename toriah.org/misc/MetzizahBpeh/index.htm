<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="4"><i>The Metziza B'peh Controversy</i></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A recent article in <i>
Pediatrics</i> (2004) authored by eleven physicians and one individual with a PhD 
(Rabbi Moshe D. Tendler), 
attempted to connect <i>metzitzah b’peh</i> and neonatal&nbsp; (infant) herpes. 
The article attempted to establish a connection between eight infants who 
experienced an outbreak of herpes on the <i>milah</i> area shortly after their
<i>bris</i> which was done by a <i>mohel</i> who performed <i>metzitzah b’peh.</i> 
This article assigned blame based on speculation rather than established 
scientific procedure and it is difficult to understand how it passed peer review 
(see article by Dr. Berman below).<br>
<br>
In 2005, a respected New York <i>mohel</i> was charged with transmitting a virus 
to three infants. In mid-October 2004, the <i>mohel</i> performed the <i>brisos</i> 
of twin infants in Brooklyn, N.Y. Ten days later, one infant died from herpes 
and the other tested positive for the virus. A few weeks later, the New York 
City Health Department found a third infant in Staten Island who also tested 
positive for herpes after being circumcised by this <i>mohel</i> in late 2003. 
The health department has released its side of the story to the mainstream 
media, pinning responsibility for the transmission on the <i>mohel</i>. The <i>
mohel’s</i> version of the story differs and vindicates him from the blame. The 
NY city health department, although claiming to have proof of their claims, has not 
produced any evidence corroborating their version. At the state level, after a 
full investigation of the issue, the Health department rescinded its injunction 
against the <i>mohel</i> and appointed the <i>Hisachdus Harabanim</i> (CRC) as 
the oversight committee.</font></p>

	Article</a> (in Yated, 03-04-05) by Dr. Berman who is Chief of Infectious 
	Disease at New York Westchester Square Hospital on the <i>
	<a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/114/2/e259">Pediatrics</a></i> 
	article. In addition to the fact that the <i>Pediatrics</i> article violated 
	established scientific protocol for proving viral transmission, the article is also 
	biased in its reporting of Jewish law (e.g. see JO article by Rabbi Reisman) 
	and is <i>motzei shem rah</i> on the community by writing that &quot;There is, 
	however, the possibility that some previous cases were not reported for 
	cultural reasons&quot;, without presenting any evidence for the truth of this 
	assertion. One of the authors of the Pediatrics article was
	<a href="http://www.cpso.on.ca/publications/discsum/2004/discmay04.htm#Koren">
	disciplined</a> by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (in a different study): 
	&quot;The Discipline Committee found that Dr. Koren committed acts of 
	professional misconduct, in that he engaged in an act or omission relevant 
	to the practice of medicine that, having regard to all the circumstances, 
	would reasonably be regarded by members as disgraceful, dishonourable or 
	unprofessional; and that his conduct was unbecoming a physician.&quot;<br>
