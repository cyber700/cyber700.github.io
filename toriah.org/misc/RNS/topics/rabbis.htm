	<p class="style3"><strong>Excerpts of a letter by Rab</strong><span class="style5"><strong>bi</strong></span><strong> 
	Aharon Feldman Shlit&quot;a, Rosh HaYeshiva Ner Yisroel</strong><em>:</em>&nbsp; 
	</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="style1"><span class="style2">&quot;Probably the public issue most damaging to the honor of Torah and to its 
	leaders in recent memory is what is known as the Slifkin affair. Rabbi Nosson Slifskin, a talented young man still in his twenties, wrote three 
	books in the past several years in which he attempted to justify certain 
	conflicts between the findings of modern science and parts of the Torah and 
	the Talmud. ... Nevertheless, in September of last year [2004] a public 
	letter banning the books was issued by some of the leading Torah authorities 
	in Israel, and then shortly afterwards a similar ban, signed by many 
	prominent American Roshey Yeshiva, was issued in the United States. The 
	books were banned because they were deemed to contain ideas antithetical to 
	Torah ...</span></span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1" class="style3"> </span>
	<span class="style3">The ban was met with resistance by Slifkin who 
	vigorously defended himself on his Internet site on several grounds.&quot; ...</span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1" class="style3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</span></p>
	<p class="style3">&quot;Slifkin’s campaign was eminently successful. In short 
	time, most people were convinced that the ban had no basis or reason, and 
	that Slifkin had been unwarrantedly victimized. His campaign made the 
	signatories appear easily swayed and naive. Easily swayed, because they had 
	relied on the “extremists” and had not sufficiently checked the accuracy of 
	their claims. Naïve, because the tumult over the ban catapulted the books 
	into best-sellerdom. The books had been previously virtually unknown but 
	after the ban began selling by the thousands even at inflated prices – which 
	meant that the ban accomplished nothing.&quot;</p>
	<p class="style3">&quot;Blogspots, 
	Internet sites (mostly anonymous) where anyone with access to a computer can 
	express his spontaneous, unchecked and unedited opinion with impunity, 
	became filled with tasteless, derogatory attacks on these authorities, at 
	times to the accompaniment of vulgar caricatures.&quot;</p>
		<span class="style3">&quot;</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: HE" class="style3">As 
	a result, many thoughtful, observant Jews were beset by a crisis of 
	confidence in the judgment of the signatories. This was an extremely vital 
	crisis since these authorities constitute some of the greatest Torah leaders 
	of our generation, authorities upon whom all of the Jewish people rely for 
	their most serious decisions. More important, it threatened to make any of 
	their future signatures on public announcements questionable. The irony of 
	it all is that the books, which had originally been written to defend the 
	honor of Torah, became one of the most potent vehicles in our times for 
	weakening the authority of Torah.&quot; ...<br>

Nathan Slifkin: <br class="style6">
<strong>Date</strong>: Mon, 27 Oct 2003 11:29:05 +0200 <br class="style6">
<strong>From</strong>: Zoo Torah &lt; @zootorah.com&gt; <br class="style6">
<strong>Subject</strong>: RE: Basics for Philosophical discussions
<br class="style6">
....<br class="style6">
Actually, if someone feels that one needs to have a sufficiently qualified 
authority upon which to rely for the allegorization of the Mabul, then I can 
provide one. It's a more authoritative source than the Rishonim. More 
authoritative even than Chazal. It's the Metziyus. Hashem's &quot;diary of history,&quot; 
the physical world, states that there was no global Flood. I think that Hashem 
is a reliable source (unless, of course, He was deliberately deceiving us...). 
There is only one metziyus. On the other hand, there are different ways of 
understanding the Torah....] </p>

</O:P></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" class="style3">As you realized on your last 
visit, my father, <i>shlita</i>, is unfortunately no longer in a position to 
discuss the issue of your books.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I 
would like to share with you some ideas I have discussed with him in the past.&nbsp;<O:P> 
</O:P></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="DIRECTION: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
<font size="2" class="style3">I have tried to imagine what would have been Rabbi

<font size="2" class="style3">1)<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-VARIANT: normal">&nbsp;</span>Rabbi Dessler advocated a healthy skepticism, to the point of contempt, 
towards the “conclusions” of scientism, in particular where these challenged the 
beliefs of a Torah Jew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>See the 
epilogue to Artscroll’s biography of Rav Dessler (p. 365), “Against the worship 
of Science”.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; DIRECTION: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
<font size="2" class="style3">He would not have taken kindly to your attitude that 
anything reported in “The New Scientist” as fact is to be accepted as such.&nbsp;<O:P>

<font size="2" class="style3">2)<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-VARIANT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rabbi Dessler, following in the footsteps of the Maharal, taught us to 
have the greatest reverence for <i>Chazal</i> and the tremendous <i>siyatta 
diShmaya</i> and divine insight that permeates all their teachings.&nbsp;<O:P> 
</O:P></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; DIRECTION: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
<font size="2" class="style3">I think that his advice to anyone tackling issues of 
science and Torah would have been to use their knowledge to discover, or come up 
with, alternative theories that the bias of scientism may have rejected, but may 
give more credence to <i>Chazal</i>.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36.75pt; DIRECTION: ltr; TEXT-INDENT: -18.75pt; unicode-bidi: embed; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 36.75pt">
<font size="2" class="style3">3)<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-VARIANT: normal">&nbsp;</span>As you may have by now discovered, the main opposition of the <i>Gedolim</i> 
is to your attempt to “re-educate” or reformulate the thinking of the chareidi 
community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As one person put it: 
“your worst crime” was to put <i>haskamos</i> on the books.&nbsp;<O:P> 
</O:P></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font size="2" class="style3">Rabbi Dessler was 
uncharacteristically outspoken in his criticism of such attempts (see letters

<font size="2" class="style3">4)<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-VARIANT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, regardless whether I am correct in my assessment of Rabbi 
Dessler’s attitude to the above, one thing is definite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the fact, Rabbi Dessler would have accepted the decision of those
<i>Rabbanim</i>, Roshei Yeshiva and Mashgichim in whose hands Hashem has 
entrusted the directions of our generation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When Hashem showed Adam and Moshe, “<i>dor dor vedorshav… manhigav</i>” 
these are the names on that list.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
We can get no closer to Hashem’s <i>ratzon</i> than by listening to our <i>
Gedolim</i> who have spent their entire lives in ascertaining the <i>emes</i> of 
Torah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if, as a result of all 
the non-Torah ideas that we have read, their opinion seems to us to be 
incorrect, Hashem wants us to follow them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their <i>siyatta diShmaya</i> in knowing what is good for <i>Klal Yisrael</i> 
is unimaginably greater than ours.<O:P> </O:P></font></p>

<font size="2" class="style3">P.s. I saw a statement on your website to the effect 
that “G-d told you that the <i>mabul</i> never happened.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I would like to draw your attention to the Radak who writes that a <i>
navi sheker</i> may truly believe that he had a Divine revelation about the 
falsehood he prophesizes about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He 
is nevertheless <i>chayav missa</i>, because as a believing Jew, he is required 
to realize that he has allowed himself to be mislead by his imaginations (or as 
a <i>horaas sha’a</i>, since he is a danger to <i>Klal Yisrael</i>.)</font></p>
