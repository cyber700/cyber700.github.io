<hr>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The acceptance of Darwin’s 
implausible theory by western civilization has come with the hidden but nasty 
baggage of moral Darwinism. The blame for the steady deterioration in the 
dignity and holiness of life as manifested in societal trends such as the call 
for euthanasia, abortion on demand, the redefinition of marriage and current 
proposals to legalize infanticide of healthy three month old babies at the whim 
of the parents, is correlated with the rise of evolution that has been promoted 
in the media and academia. E.O. Wilson (Harvard) and Michael Ruse (Florida State 
University) write as follows:</font></p>

with ethics, but how</span></font><a name="_ftnref1" title href="#_ftn1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Verdana">[1]</font></span></span></a><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-CA">.</span></font></p>

Morality, or more strictly our belief in morality, is merely an adaptation put 
in place to further our reproductive ends. Hence the basis of ethics does not 
lie in G-d’s will.... In an important sense, ethics as we understand it is an 
illusion fobbed off on us by our genes to get us to cooperate. It is without 
external grounding. Like Macbeth's dagger, it serves a powerful purpose without

In this compelling and painstakingly researched work of intellectual history, 
Richard Weikart explains the revolutionary impact Darwinism had on ethics and 
morality. He demonstrates that many leading Darwinian biologists and social 
thinkers in Germany believed that Darwinism overturned traditional 
Judeo-Christian and Enlightenment ethics, especially those pertaining to the 
sacredness of human life. Many of these thinkers supported moral relativism, yet 
simultaneously exalted evolutionary “fitness” (especially in terms of 
intelligence and health) as the highest arbiter of morality. Weikart concludes 
that Darwinism played a key role not only in the rise of eugenics, but also in 
euthanasia, infanticide, abortion, and racial extermination, all ultimately 
embraced by the Nazis. He convincingly makes the disturbing argument that Hitler 
built his view of ethics on Darwinian principles rather than ni­hilistic ones. 
From Darwin to Hitler is a provoca­tive yet balanced work that should encourage 
a rethinking of the historical impact that Darwin­ism had on the course of 
events in the twentieth century.</span></font><a name="_ftnref4" title href="#_ftn4"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Verdana">[4]</font></span></span></a></p>

<p class="quote"><font face="Verdana"><b><span lang="EN-CA">Stalin</span></b><span lang="EN-CA">: 
At a very early age, while still a pupil in the ecclesiastical school, Comrade
<i>Stalin</i> developed a critical mind and revolutionary sentiments. He began 
to read Darwin and became an atheist. G. Glurdjidze, a boyhood friend of 
Stalin's, relates: “I began to speak of God, Joseph heard me out, and after a 
moment's silence, said: “You know, they are fooling us, there is no God.” … I 
was astonished at these words, I had never heard anything like it before. “How 
can you say such things, Soso?” I exclaimed. “I'll lend you a book to read; it 
will show you that the world and all living things are quite different from what 
you imagine, and all this talk about God is sheer nonsense,” Joseph said. “What 
book is that?” I enquired. “<i>Darwin</i>. You must read it,” Joseph impressed 
on me.</span></font><a name="_ftnref5" title href="#_ftn5"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Verdana">[5]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="quote">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote"><font face="Verdana"><b><span lang="EN-CA">Mao</span></b><span lang="EN-CA">: 
Although <i>Charles Darwin</i> never visited China, his ideas landed there with 
force. Darwinism was the first great Western theory to make an impact on the 
Chinese and, from 1895 until at least 1921, when Marxism gained a formal 
foothold, it was the dominant Western &quot;ism&quot; influencing Chinese politics and 
thought. The authority of Darwin, sometimes misinterpreted, influenced reformers 
and revolutionaries and paved the way for Chinese Marxism and the thought of <i>
Mao Tse-tung</i>. This study evaluates Darwin's theory of evolution as a 
stimulus to Chinese political changes and philosophic challenge to traditional 
Chinese beliefs. James Pusey bases his analysis on a survey of journals issued 
from 1896 to 1910 and, after a break for revolutionary action, from 1915 to 
1926, with emphasis on the era between the Sino-Japanese War and the Republician 
Revolution. The story of Darwinism in China involves, among others, the most 
famous figures of modern Chinese intellectual history.</span></font><a name="_ftnref6" title href="#_ftn6"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Verdana">[6]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="quote"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="EN-CA">With 
Darwinism and the philosophy of its Marxist ally in the air, it was no accident 
that scientists and philosophers embraced the bloody politics of 
totalitarianism. The Nobel Prize Werner Heisenberg was in charge of the Nazi 
atom bomb project, the German existentialist philosopher Martin Heidegger became 
an avid supported of the Nazis and the influential French Hegelian philosopher 
and Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;, Alexandre Koj&egrave;ve, paid tribute to Stalin and Mao.</span></font><a name="_ftnref7" title href="#_ftn7"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Verdana">[7]</font></span></span></a><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="EN-CA">
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="EN-CA">Western 
civilization has also been much influenced. The famous Princeton bioethecist 
Peter Singer and others now argue that because Darwinism effectively discredits 
the biblical conception of the sanctity of human life, therefore abortion, 
euthanasia and even infanticide are open to “moral” justification. </span>
Singer's<span lang="EN-CA"> 
justification comes, in part, from Michael Tooley, who is professor of philosophy 
at Colorado State University. Tooley’s 1983 work, <em>Abortion and Infanticide</em>, is a 
400-page “dispassionate, philosophically sophisticated, tightly reasoned brief 
for killing babies”. Tooley argues that it is only at about three months of age 
that a limited capacity for thought-episodes first emerges, at which point a 
baby becomes a “quasi-person”. Healthy new-born babies are neither persons nor 
even quasipersons, and their destruction is in no way intrinsically wrong.

skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to 
believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak constitution 
would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilised 
societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of 
domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of 
man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads 
to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man 
himself, hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.

<b>Your children</b>: In a book called <i>Darwin's Dangerous Idea</i> (1995), 
which Dawkins warmly endorsed, Dennett portrayed Darwinism as “a universal 
solvent, capable of cutting right to the heart of everything in sight” – and 
particularly effective in dissolving religious beliefs. The most ardent 
creationist could not have said it with more conviction, but Dennett’s agreement 
with them ended there. He despised creationists, arguing that “there are no 
forces on this planet more dangerous to us all than the fanaticisms of 
fundamentalism.” Displaying a degree of intolerance more characteristic of a 
fanatic Fundamentalist than an academic philosopher, he called for “caging” 
those who would deliberately misinform children about the natural world, just as 
one would cage a threatening wild animal. “The message is clear,” he wrote: 
“those who will not accommodate, who will not temper, who insist on keeping only 
the purest and wildest strain of their heritage alive, we will be obliged, 
reluctantly, to cage or disarm, and we will do our best to disable the memes 
[traditions] they fight for.” With the bravado of a man unmindful that only 11 
percent of the public shared his enthusiasm for naturalistic evolution, he 
warned parents that if they insisted on teaching their children “falsehoods – 
that the Earth is flat, that ‘Man’ is not a product of evolution by natural 
selection – then you must expect, at the very least, that those of us who have 
freedom of speech will feel free to describe your teachings as the spreading of 
falsehoods, and will attempt to demonstrate this to your children at our 
earliest opportunity.” Those who resisted conversion to Dennett's scientific 
fundamentalism would be subject to “quarantine”.</font></span><a name="_ftnref13" title href="#_ftn13"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Verdana">[13]</font></span></span></a><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">

	<p>Here are some further quotations from Peter Singer from his books <em>
	Rethinking Life</em> <em>and Death</em> and <em>Writings on an Ethical Life</em>.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><i>On how mothers should be permitted to kill their offspring until 
		the age of 28 days</i>: &quot;My colleague Helga Kuhse and I suggest that a 
		period of twenty-eight days after birth might be allowed before an 
		infant is accepted as having the same right to life as others.&quot;</p>
		<p><i>On why abortion is less morally significant than killing a rat:</i> 
		&quot;Rats are indisputably more aware of their surroundings, and more able 
		to respond in purposeful and complex ways to things they like or 
		dislike, than a fetus at ten or even thirty-two weeks gestation.&quot;</p>
		<p><i>On why pigs, chickens and fish have more rights to life than 
		unborn humans:</i> &quot;The calf, the pig, and the much-derided chicken come 
		out well ahead of the fetus at any stage of pregnancy, while if we make 
		the comparison with a fetus of less than three months, a fish would show 
		more signs of consciousness.&quot;</p>
		<p><i>On why infants aren't normal human beings with rights to life and 
		liberty:</i> &quot;Characteristics like rationality, autonomy and 
		self-consciousness...make a difference. Infants lack these 
		characteristics. Killing them, therefore, cannot be equated with killing 
		normal human beings.&quot;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Singer argues in favor of infanticide, 
	euthanasia and (amazingly, at the same time) animal rights! One of Singer's 
	interesting proposals concerns (see above) is what may be called &quot;fourth 
	trimester&quot; abortions, i.e. the right to kill one's offspring even after 
	birth! The Biblical tradition introduced the concept of the value and 
	dignity of human life to western civilization. Howeever, according to 
	Singer, we have to get rid of this outdated concept. We should recognize 
	ourselves as Darwinian primates who enjoy no special status compared to the 
	other animals. In the animal kingdom, after all, parents sometimes kill and 
	even devour their offpsring. Singer argues that the West can learn from the 
	other cultures like the Kalahari bushmen where children are routinely killed 
	when they are unwanted, even when they are several years old.<br>
