		<h3>Contra Rabbi Slifkin's naturalistic approach to creation</h3>
		<p class="style7">Chazal (Chagiga 12a) state that the name <em>Shin-Dalet-Yud</em> 
		represents the idea that during the creative process the universe 
		continued to expand “like two clues of warp” until the end of the 
		creative process at which point Hashem said “<em>dai</em>”, enough, and 
		established the final limitations of physical law. What emerges from 
		this <em>maamar</em> <em>Chazal</em> is as follows: <br />
		<br />
		1) There are two exclusive periods in the history of the universe; the 
		“Creation” period and the “post-Creation” period. During the Creation 
		period, as the laws of nature were first being brought into existence, 
		they remained in a constant state of flux. This represented the period 
		of Creation. Subsequently, <em>Hashem</em> said “<em>dai</em>” and 
		“reigned in the expansion”, that is, he stabilized the laws of nature 
		such that they became static, unchanging. <br />
		<br />
		2) The creative process did not happen all at once. It lasted the entire
		<em>sheshes yimey bereishis</em> and culminated with <em>Shabbos</em> at 
		which point the creative process was permanently suspended and the laws 
		of nature permanently fixed. <em>Shabbos</em> is a commemoration of this 
		idea as the <em>pasuk</em> states (<em>Shmos</em> 20:10)… why have I 
		commanded you to keep the <em>Shabbos</em> on the seventh day? “ki”
		<strong>because</strong>, “sheshes yamim asa Hashem es hashamayim…vayanch 
		bayom hashevee’ee…al kayn… <strong>therefore</strong> I have sanctified 
		the seventh day etc. In other words, the “creation process” was not an 
		instantaneous affair but lasted a duration of time referred to as <em>sheshes yamim
		</em>and we celebrate <em>Shabbos</em> on the seventh day 
		to commemorate this event (see MN I:67).

		<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: David" class="style11">Know that He, 
		may His name be blessed, caused all of reality to materialize into 
		existence during the six days of creation Himself, in His own Glory (<i>b’chvodo 
		u’veatzmo</i>) and <strong>not through the agency of nature</strong>, as 
		opposed to the period which ensues after the six days of creation in 
		which <i>Hashem</i>, may His name be blessed, guides his creation </span>
		</span><span class="style11">via an agent, referred to as nature. (Be’er 
		haGola - pg 83, second column last paragraph).</span></p>
		<p class="style7"><br />
		3) There are two ramifications that surface from the above-stated idea. 
		a) The creative process cannot be duplicated in a post-Creation period. 
		b) Attempting to reconcile post-Creation imperatives with the 
		fundamental dynamics of the Creation period is essentially impossible. 
		In the opinion of <a href="../misc/Rabb-SE-Miller-re-Slifkin-Eng.pdf">Rav Shlomo Miller Shlit&quot;a,</a> advancing a theory which 
		contravenes the first ramification (a) by conflating these two distinct 
		periods denies the core principle of <em>Shabbos</em> whereas attempting to 
		reconcile phenomena which appear to contradict the Torah by positing, 
		say, day-age theories, in opposition to the second ramification, does 
		not constitute <em>kefira</em>, although it does violate our <em>mesorah</em>.<br />
		<br />
		When Rabbi Slifkin writes conclude that “Naturalistic Darwinian 
		evolution is fully compatible with religion” (Challenge of Creation pg. 
		294) or that “the blind-watchmaker thesis need not be incompatible with 
		G-d” (Challenge of Creation pg. 297) he has in essence contravened the 
		first of the two ramifications above. The reason is because <strong>
		evolution</strong> is a purely <strong>naturalistic</strong> process 
		(albeit, in Rabbi Slifkin's opinion, guided by G-d) which can, and currently is being duplicated in 
		the post-Creation period. The problem is, ramification (a) states that 
		the creation process is unable to be duplicated via the normal <em>
		chukey</em> <em>haTeva</em> which obtain in the post-Creation period
		<strong>without a specialized </strong><em><strong>ma’amar</strong></em><strong>
		</strong><em><strong>Hashem</strong></em><strong> to activate this 
		process</strong>. When we celebrate <em>Shabbos</em>, we are testifying 
		to the idea that the world came about via a unique, <strong>meta-natural</strong> 
		creative process which is entirely removed from the current <em>chukey 
		haTeva</em>. We are affirming that the current laws of nature are 
		entirely inadequate as a means of bringing about the phenomena of the 
		universe. <br />
		<br />
		The role of “<strong>Boreh</strong>” is entirely different than the role 
		of “<strong>Manhig</strong>” in the sense that the very laws of nature, 
		the imperatives which govern the cosmos, space, time, mass, energy, life 
		etc., all this was only able to come into existence via <em>Hashem</em> 
		exercising his role as <em>Boreh</em>. Subsequently, He transformed his 
		relationship to the universe from <em>Boreh</em> to that of <em>Manhig</em> 
		by suspending the creative process and permanently establishing the laws 
		of nature and the fixity of the various species of life on earth. These 
		laws continue to be repeated over and over again but cannot, under any 
		circumstances, be understood within the context of possessing the 
		ability of self-perpetuation. For that, only the role of <em>Boreh</em> 
		suffices. Thus, by subscribing to the evolutionary paradigm which 
		utilizes currently understood laws of nature to describe the appearance 
		of all of the species of life on earth, one is contravening the idea 
		that these laws are inadequate as a means of perpetuating life. It 
		contravenes the idea that only <em>Hashem</em>, functioning in His role 
		as <em>Boreh</em>, can possibly bring about life whether plant, animal 
		or human. The same issue applies to other theories such as Big Bang 
		cosmology. Since <em>Shabbos</em> was established specifically to 
		commemorate this very idea, by subscribing to origins theories which 
		utilize post-Creation imperatives, we undermine the very essence of <em>
		Shabbos</em>. <br />
		<br />
		At this point, it should be clear that while the issue of literal versus 
		allegorical interpretation is important, this is not the direct issue 
		issue at stake here. The issue is the conflation of the Creation and 
		post Creation periods which ultimately leads to an undermining of the 
		essence of <em>Shabbos</em>. <br />
		<br />
		As far as ramification (b) is concerned, Rav Miller feels that if someone 
		wishes to believe that the universe is billions of years old and the six 
		day period of <em>maaseh bereishis</em> is six time periods, he is not 
		undermining <em>Shabbos</em> as long as he believes that these billions 
		of years all occurred within the meta-natural miraculous framework of “<em>Beriah</em>” 
		(as explained above) which 
		does not utilize currently understood laws of nature and thus cannot be 
		duplicated today. As far as Rav Shlomo’s personal position, he believes 
		in a literal six day creation because he believes in the <em>mesorah</em> 
		and sees no reason why we must contravene it. This is what he meant by 
		bringing down the <em>ma’amar</em> <em>Chazal</em> regarding Kayin and Hevel’s birth. 
		Since the very laws of nature themselves were first being formed during 
		the Creation period, any number of random violations of those laws was 
		possible. The actual truth is entirely unknowable because we do not 
		possess a frame of reference by which we can compare (as the <em>pasuk</em> 
		in <em>Iyov</em> states “Where were you when I laid the earth's 
		foundation? Tell me, if you possess understanding” 38:4) and thus he 
		feels that the best course of action is to simply follow the <em>mesorah</em>.
		<br />
		<br />
		The following is taken from notes by Rav Miller (<em>Motzai</em> Pesach 
		5766) which says it all. <br />
