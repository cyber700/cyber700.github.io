		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
		<span class="style6">For the Rambam, Adam is a real historical figure created on the sixth 
		day in the image of God (no less real than our patriarch Abraham). An 
		explicit prooftext such as this, of course, settles the matter 
		conclusively. There is no allegory. The first man </span>
		<span class="style12">Adam</span><span class="style6"> and the 
		first woman </span><span class="style12">Chava</span><span class="style6"> are real historical personalities, the 
		ancestors of all mankind. </span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="style5"><font size="3" class="style6"><span class="style8">
		Rabbi Slifkin quotes an Abarbanel (A1) in which the Abarbanel at first 
		attributes an allegorical&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; to the Rambam.&nbsp; [This 
		attribution can be found in the Abarbanel’s commentary on Chumash Bereishis 
		(1:1) question #9.]</span></font><span class="style7"> </span> <font size="3" class="style6">
		<span class="style8">However, <strong>Rabbi Slifkin omitted to quote two 
		essential subsequent comments of the Abarbanel</strong> (see A2 and A3 
		below). In chapter 2 ( just after question #42), the Abarbanel revisits 
		the issue of allegory in the Rambam, at which point Abarbanel writes as 
		follows:</span></font></p>
		<p class="style10"><font size="3"><span class="style7">&nbsp;</span></font><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="style7"><strong>A2:</strong> 
		&quot;Behold you see that the opinion of the Rav (the Rambam) was not that 
		all of MB was an allegory, rather, only a small part of it (some 
		elements in the second chapter of Bereishis, not the first), and that 
		all which is mentioned [in the Torah]&nbsp; regarding the activity of 
		the six days, from the creation of the heavens and the earth, <strong>
		and all of the phenomena, and the creation of Adam and his wife, up 
		until [the passage of] &quot;v'yichulu&quot;, have no allegory whatsoever for 
		everything was [understood as] literal to him </strong>and therefore you 
		will see that in this very chapter, #30 in the second section, in all 
		which the Rav has explicated regarding the activity of the six days, he 
		did not make [of MB] an allegory or a hint (pirush tzurayi oh remez) at 
		all; rather, he did the exact opposite, for he made a concerted effort 
		to support the doctrine of creation ex nihilo and accepted all of the 
		verses literally...&quot; (Abarbanel to Sefer Bereishis page 86, second 
		column, 14 lines down)</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><span class="style7">&nbsp;</span></font><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="style7">When 
		the Abarbanel wishes to characterize the ‘hierarchal scenario” of 
		creation, he refers to it as <em>tzurayi</em> (i.e form, allegory – see 
		for instance bottom of page 85, left column and top of page 86 right 
		column) and thus when he ultimately states “he did not make [of creation] an 
		allegory or a hint (pirush tzurayi oh remez) at all” he means that the 
		Rambam entirely rejected the hierarchal explanation in favour of a 
		literal reading.</span></font><font size="3"><span class="style7">&nbsp;</span></font><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="style7">The 
		Abarbanel on his actual commentary to the <em>Moreh</em> (Standard 
		Ibn Tibbon edition pg. 64b first column on the bottom) confirms this 
		approach as follows.</span></font></p>
		<p class="style10"><span class="style7"><strong>A3</strong>: </span>
		<font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="style7">And 
		the Rav (Rambam) also meant with this to what he stated at the end of 
		chapter 29 and chapter 30 of this <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">
		chelek, </span></i>and this is that the true <i>
		<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">chiddush</span></i> (i.e. creation from 
		nothing) is what is described in the verses regarding the six days of 
		creation…<strong>and it is entirely litera</strong>l and therefore the
		<strong>seventh day</strong> was the day of rest to demonstrate that 
		after all was completed on the sixth day, nothing more was created…<strong>and 
		in order to testify to this great thing</strong>, <strong>Shabbos</strong> 
		was established as the seventh day to hint at and make known that 
		absolutely nothing was created after the sixth day… </span></font></p>
		<p class="style7">The truth is the Abarbanel had no choice in the 
		matter. The Rambam is so clear regarding this issue that it is 
		impossible to think differently. The Abarbanel (A2 above) writes that 
		the Rambam &quot;did not veer from the literal interpretation&quot; of the Genesis 
		verses in response to the following prooftext in <em>Moreh Nevuchim</em>.</p>
		<p class="style10"><span class="style15">The account of the six days of 
		creation contains, in reference to the creation of man, the statement: 
		“Male and female created he them” (1:27), and concludes with the words: 
		“Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them” 
		(2:1), and yet the portion which follows describes <strong>the creation 
		of Eve from Adam, the tree of life, and the tree of knowledge, the 
		history of the serpent</strong> and the events connected therewith, and 
		all this as having taken place after Adam had been placed in the Garden 
		of Eden. <strong>All our Sages agree that this took place on the sixth 
		day, and that nothing new was created after the close of the six days</strong>. 
		None of the things mentioned above is therefore impossible, <strong>
		because the laws of Nature were then not yet permanently fixed</strong></span><span class="style8"> 
		[Moreh Nevuchim 2.30]</span></p>
		<p><span class="style8">As we saw, contra the </span><em>
		<span class="style8">Challenge</span></em><span class="style8"> quotes, 
		the Abarbanel's opinion (A2, A3) is that the Rambam took the whole first 
		chapter of the Torah literally. But the Abarbanel also writes that, 
		according to the Rambam,&nbsp; some of the events (e.g. the serpent) in 
		the second chapter of the Torah are to be treated in the same way as 
		Jacob's dream about the ladder reaching down from heavens (presumably 
		this means that, like Jacob's dreams, the temptation was real enough but 
		not that there was an actual serpent). However, the above prooftext 
		indicates that the Rambam took the whole second chapter literally as 
		well, as is stated by </span><em><span class="style8">Rabbenu Crescas</span></em><span class="style8"> 
		in his commentary to the <em>Moreh</em>.</span></p>
		<p class="style1">It is clear, according to the opinion of the Rambam, 
		that in the account of Adam and Chava, the matter of the serpent, the 
		tree of life and the tree of knowledge all are possible as literally 
		stated (<i>kemashmayo</i>), since nature was not yet established.
		<strong>New formations not previously in existence came into existence 
		on each of six days of the creation week.</strong> So too, the matters 
		mentioned such as Adam, Chava and the other events all happened 
		literally (<i>kepeshutam</i>) because they occurred on day six. </p>
		<p class="style16" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: David; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: HE">
		[With respect to Adam and Chava created as a single entity:] <strong>
		Nobody questions the historical truth of the creation of Adam and Chava, 
		the account of Cain, Abel, Seth, the tree of life, and the tree of 
		knowledge</strong>. However, the Sages, by way of <strong>hint</strong> 
		(<i>remez</i>) have enlightened us with [additional] precious insights. 
		The Rambam, who is the Teacher of Righteousness, was drawn after the 
		Sages to expound their meaning [in their comment that the first couple 
		was created a single entity].</p>
		<p class="style7">The prooftexts (above and below) establish the 
		following important ideas in the Rambam.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p class="style6"><span class="style8">The first chapter of 
			the Torah is not allegorical at all. Rather it is a historical
			</span><strong><span class="style8">meta-natural</span></strong><span class="style8"> account of the creation of the cosmos. 
			Creation is unable to be duplicated via chance and naturalistic 
			processes which obtain in the post-Creation period without a 
			specialized </span><em><span class="style8">ma’amar Hashem</span></em><span class="style8"> to activate this process. 
			</span></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="style7">The meta-natural creative process did not 
			happen all at once. It lasted the entire </span>

			and culminated with </span> <em><span class="style8">Shabbos</span></em><span class="style8"> at which point the creative 
			process was permanently suspended and the laws of nature permanently 
			fixed. The first man was a historical personality, created,

			<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:
     EN-CA">When the Rambam discusses the grammatical connotation of the word <i>
			va’yanch</i> in the <i>dibra</i> which relates to Shabbos (Shmos 
			20:10), the Rambam states as follows: “[and the grammatical context 
			of the word <i>vayanach</i>] is that [Hashem] caused reality to 
			perpetuate in the state that it existed on the seventh day. In other 
			words, every single day of the six days saw a process which caused 
			new events to come into existence, [a process] which transcends the 
			fixed nature which currently obtains in the universe in general (Moreh 
			- Kapach ed. pg. 111). <br />

			<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:

			the Torah is there for one of two purposes. Either it is there to 
			reinforce a <i>hashkafa</i> which relates to one of the fundamentals 
			of the Torah, or it appears in the Torah as a form of <i>tikun olam,
			</i>a societal infrastructure which facilitates harmony amongst 
			mankind. If so, asks the Rambam, what is the purpose of all the 
			generations listed between Adam haRishon and Avraham Avinu? Here’s 
			the Rambam’s response: “Since it is a fundamental doctrine of the 
			Torah that the world is newly created and that the first [human] 
			creation was Adam and that the time which elapsed from Adam to Moshe 
			is approximately 2,500 years…etc.” and the Rambam goes on to explain 
			that anyone viewing such a diversified world with so many 
			inhabitants belonging to so many different cultures speaking so many 
			different languages spread out over such large geographical 
			locations, might doubt the recentness of creation and the fact that 
			initially, only one man was created. Therefore, the Torah goes out 
			of its way to list the specific generations which unfolded from Adam 
			to Moshe, who their leaders were, what occurred to them, and that 
			they originally all spoke one language as one would expect from a 
			society which descended from one lone man (Moreh 3:50 - Kapach ed. 
			pg 400) <br />

			first took place as follows: “When did they first start to count? 14 
			years after they entered the land…7 years they were involved in 
			conquering, seven years in dividing up the land…it therefore turns 
			out that on the two thousandth, five hundred and third year from the 
			Rosh Hashana of <i>molad</i> <i>Adam haRishon,</i> being the second
