		<h3>Rabbi Slifkin's Blind Watchmaker Thesis and the Panda's &quot;<span class="style7">Poorly Designed</span>&quot; 
		Extraordinarily Designed Thumb</h3>
<p class="style3">In his book <em>Challenge of Creation</em> (2006), Rabbi 
Slifkin asserts that there is convincing evidence that the marvels of life are 
due to chance and <strong>naturalistic</strong> processes (such as random 
mutation and natural selection). </p>
		<p class="style3">Given that he accepts the billions of years of 
naturalistic evolution, <a href="challenge-quotes.htm">Rabbi Slifkin is forced 
to deny</a> the existence of the first man and women (<em>Adam</em> 
and <em>Chava</em>), created on the sixth day in the image of God, as a 
historical fact. Rather, he believes that the first three chapters of the Torah 
is pretty much a total allegory. Thus there was no <strong>meta-natural</strong> 
creation week as described in the first chapter of Genesis.</p>
<p class="style3">Following Darwin (and <a href="darwin-and-genocide.htm">Ruse</a>) he believes that man is a sort of 
&quot;modified monkey&quot; evolved from hominid precursors. This is why Rabbi Slifkin 
aligns himself with Darwinians who believe in vestigial organs, embryological 
debris and poorly designed structures such as the Panda's thumb. While this type 
of belief is supportive of atheism, Rabbi Slifkin believes that we can 
nevertheless be &quot;religious Darwinists&quot;. “Naturalistic Darwinian evolution is 
fully compatible with religion” (Challenge p. 294). “The blind-watchmaker thesis 
need not be incompatible with God” (Challenge p. 297).</p>
<p class="style3">Consider a section titled &quot;<strong>Imperfect Design from a 
Perfect Creator</strong>&quot;&nbsp; in which Rabbi Slifkin writes 
as follows:</p>
<div class="style4">
	<p class="style3"><span class="style5">Stephen Jay Gould [Harvard 
	University] has elaborated upon this argument in his work </span><em>
	<span class="style5">The Panda's Thumb</span></em><span class="style5"> 
	[1980]. 
	Pandas do not have an opposable thumb that is one of the five digits, as do 
	other animals with grasping hands. Instead, they have a modification of the 
	wrist bone, which serves to help grasp bamboo. Such a &quot;thumb&quot; makes sense in 
	light of Darwinian evolution; the thumb was already pressed into use as a 
	finger, leaving natural selection to operate with the wrist bone. But, 
	argues Gould, this is too </span><strong><span class="style5">inefficient a 
	limb </span></strong><span class="style5">to be the work of a wise Creator. 
	There are other features of organisms that not only appear </span><strong>
	<span class="style5">poorly designed</span></strong><span class="style5">, 
	but are even potentially detrimental. ... Evolutionists correctly argue that 
	these indicate descent from earlier species; atheist evolutionists 
	incorrectly argue that they disprove the existence of a wise Creator. ...</span></p>
	<p class="style3"><span class="style5">We can therefore plausibly contend 
	that He [the Creator] would use the simplest means to obtain the complex 
	goal of the world in which we live. It is a mark of genius to create a 
	system that can produce a panda from a non-panda (</span><strong><span class="style5">even 
	at the cost of having an inflexible thumb</span></strong><span class="style5">), 
	rather than having to design one from scratch. Far from being a menace to 
	religion, boundless&nbsp; Darwinian evolution assists in explaining an 
	age-old problem of why there existence no are so many features of living 
	things that seem </span><strong><span class="style5">poorly designed</span></strong><span class="style5">, 
	useless, or even harmful. [</span><em>Challenge</em> p. 303-304,
	<span class="style5">Emphasis added]</span></p>
</div>
<p class="style3">The main problem with this line of reasoning is that, even if 
it true that the Panda's thumb is poorly designed, there are no detailed 
testable Darwinian pathways that can explain wrist bones, thumbs, the muscle, 
nerve and the brain mechanisms needed to run all this machinery (robots that 
perform these functions are the product of advanced design techniques).</p>
<p class="style3">However, a 1999 study in Nature analyzed the giant panda's 
thumb using computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and related 
techniques. Contrary to Rabbi Slifkin's and Gould &quot;poorly designed&quot; panda's 
thumb, the study shows that the radial sesamoid bone (its &quot;thumb&quot;) is &quot;one of 
the most extraordinary manipulation systems&quot; among mammals.</p>
<div class="style4">
	<p class="style3"><span class="style5">The way in which the giant <strong>panda</strong>, <em>
	Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>, uses the radial sesamoid bone — its ‘<strong>pseudo-thumb</strong>’ 
	— for grasping makes it one of the most <strong>extraordinary manipulation 
	systems</strong> in mammalian evolution. ...</p>
	<p class="style3">The three-dimensional images we obtained indicate that the 
	radial sesamoid bone cannot move independently of its articulated bones, as 
	has been suggested, but rather acts as part of a functional unit of 
	manipulation. The radial sesamoid bone and the accessory carpal bone form a 
	double pincer-like apparatus in the medial and lateral sides of the hand, 
	respectively, enabling the panda to manipulate objects with <strong>great 
	dexterity</strong>. ...</p>
	<p class="style3">We have shown that the hand of the giant panda has a much 
	more refined grasping mechanism than has been suggested in previous 
	morphological models.</p>
	<p class="style3"><font color="#000000"><a name="02"></a>[Endo, H., Yamagiwa, 
	D., Hayashi, Y. H., Koie, H., Yamaya, Y., and Kimura, J. 1999. <i>Nature</i>

</div>
<p class="style3">&nbsp;Evolutionists such as Gould say that the design of the 
Panda's thumb is poor compared to that of the primate opposable thumb. However, 
the opposable thumb is not designed for continuous grasping (and may even result 
in carpal tunnel syndrome). The Giant Panda is a herbivore that spends nearly 
all of its waking hours eating by collecting bamboo leaves (by grasping) and 
stripping leaves from the stalks. The Panda's hand, with its &quot;thumb&quot; directly 
bound to the metacarpals, is a much stronger design able to withstand continuous 
use. Here is the relevant quote from Gould.</p>
		<p class="style6">The panda's thumb provides an elegant zoological 
		counterpart to Darwin's orchids. An engineer' best solution is debarred 
		by history. The panda' true thumb is committed to another role, too 
		specialized for a different function to become an opposable, 
		manipulating digit. <strong>So the panda must use parts on hand and 
		settle for an enlarged wrist bone and a somewhat clumsy</strong>, but 
		quite workable, solution. The sesamoid thumb wins no prize in an 
		engineer's derby. It is, to use Michael Ghiselin's phrase - a 
		contraption; not a lovely contrivance. ...<strong><br />
		<br />
		Darwin's</strong> metaphor for organic form reflects his sense of wonder 
		that evolution can fashion such a world of diversity and adequate design 
		with such limited raw material: &quot;Although an organ may not have been 
		originally formed for some special purpose, if it now serves for this 
		end we are justified in saying that it is specially contrived for it. On 
		the same principle, if a man were to make a machine for some special 
		purpose, but were to use old wheels, springs, and pulleys, only slightly 
		altered, the whole machine, with all its parts, might be said to be 
		specially contrived for that purpose. Thus throughout nature almost 
		every part of each living being has probably served, in a slightly 
		modified condition, for diverse purposes, and has acted in the living 
		machinery of many ancient and distinct specific forms.&quot; <br />
		<br />
		We may not be flattered by the metaphor of refurbished wheels and 
		pulleys, but consider how well we work. <strong>Nature</strong> is, in 
		biologist Francois Jacob's words, an excellent <strong>tinkerer</strong>, 
		not a divine artificer. And who shall sit in judgment between these 
		exemplary skills? [ Stephen Jay Gould, <strong>The Panda's Thumb</strong>: 
		More Reflections in Natural History, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1980 ]</p>
		<p class="style3">Gould had already started arguing in 1971 that 
		Darwin's mechanism was insufficient to account for what he calls 
		&quot;nature’s irreducible complexity&quot;. In 1971, he and Eldredge introduced a 
		new naturalistic mechanism called &quot;punctutated equilibrium intended to 
		answer the question as to why the fossil record is so anti-Darwinian. In 
		the Prologue to Panda's Thumb, Gould writes:</p>
		<p class="style8"><span class="style5">&quot;Y</span>et, while Darwinian 
		theory extends its domain, <strong>some of its cherished postulates are 
		slipping</strong>, or at least losing their generality. The &quot;modern 
		synthesis,&quot; the contemporary version of Darwinism that has reigned for 
		thirty years, took the model of adaptive gene substitution within local 
		populations as an adequate account, by accumulation and extension, of 
		life's entire history. The model may work well in its empirical domain 
		of minor, local, adaptive adjustment; populations of the moth Biston 
		betularia did turn black, by substitution of a single gene, as a 
		selected response for decreased visibility on trees that had been 
		blackened by industrial soot [note to reader: subsequent to Gould 
		writing this the evolutionary icon of the peppered moth has been 
		debunked]. But is the origin of a new species simply this process 
		extended to more genes and greater effect? Are larger evolutionary 
		trends within major lineages just a further accumulation of sequential 
		adaptive changes? </p>
		<p class="style8">Many evolutionists (myself included) are beginning to 
		challenge this synthesis and to assert that the hierarchical view that 
		different levels of evolutionary change often reflect different kinds of 
		causes. ...</p>
		<p class="style8">But we must reckon with a <strong>multiplicity of 
		mechanisms</strong> that preclude the explanation of higher level 
		phenomena by the model of adaptive gene substitution favored for the 
		lowest level.</p>
		<p class="style8"><strong>At the basis of all this ferment</strong> lies
		<strong>nature’s irreducible complexity.</strong> Organisms are not 
		billiard balls, propelled by simple and measurable external forces to 
		predictable new positions on life’s pool table. Sufficiently complex 
		systems have greater richness. Organisms have a history that constrains 
		their future in myriad, subtle ways (see essays of section I). Their 
		complexity of form entails a host of functions incidental to whatever 
		pressures of natural selection superintended the initial construction 
		(see essay 4). Their <strong>intricate</strong> and <strong>largely 
		unknown pathways </strong>of embryonic development guarantee that simple 
		inputs (minor changes in timing, for example) may be translated into 
		marked and surprising changes in output (the adult organism, see essay 
		18). [Emphasis added, p15-6].</p>
		<p class="style3">Thus Gould's argument from the Panda's thumb was not 
		an argument about mechanism (neo-Darwinian or punctuated equilibrium), 
		but an attempt to &quot;prove&quot; the so-called &quot;fact&quot; of evolution (common 
		descent). Gould writes:</p>
		<p class="style8">&quot;I have tried to weld these essays into an integrated 
		whole by organizing them into eight sections. The first on <strong>
		pandas</strong>, turtles and anglerfish, illustrates <strong>why we can 
		be confident that evolution occurred.</strong> The argument embodies an 
		paradox: the proof of evolution&nbsp; lies in <strong>imperfections</strong> 
		that reveal history. [Prologue to &quot;Panda's Thumb&quot;, page 12-13].</p>
		<p class="style3">Gould was here attempting to show that nature is an 
		&quot;an excellent tinkerer, not a divine artificer&quot;, i.e. he was trying to 
		show that nature has the power to create contrivances such as the 
		Panda's Thumb without the need for the Creator. It's a pity that the 
		late Steven J. Gould (both Jewish and a <em>kohen</em>) could be so 
		profoundly wrong.</p>
		<p class="style3">A vitriolic and (in-)famous anti-ID blog calls itself 
		&quot;The Panda's Thumb&quot;. Their posted mission statement asserts that the &quot;<em>The 
		Panda's Thumb</em> is many things. First, it is an example of 
		jury-rigged evolutionary adaptation made famous by the late Stephen Jay 
		Gould in an essay of the same name.&quot; The Panda's thumb is a a site that 
		is highly recommended by the anti-creation site <em>talk.origins</em>. 
		The main page of the site <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/"></a>
		invites us to visit the Pandas's Thumb as follows:</p>
		<p class="style8"><strong>Visit the Panda's Thumb</strong>. The Panda's 
		Thumb is dedicated to explaining the theory of evolution, critiquing the 
		claims of the anti-evolution movement, and defending the integrity of 
		science and science education in America and around the world.<br />
		(talk.orgins, accessed Nov. 24, 2006)</p>
		<p class="style3">No blog has been so poorly named given that scientists 
		now believe that the Panda's thumb is an &quot;extraordinary manipulation 
		system&quot;.</p>
		<p class="style3">The opposition blog is a pro-ID blog called &quot;Uncommon 
		Descent&quot;. A recent remark on this blog by Paul Nelson is interesting. 
		Paul Nelson (Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in Philosophy 1998) is 
		a fellow at the Discovery Intelligent Design think tank, where he 
		specializes in the philosophy of biology. He writes:</p>
		<p class="style6">It’s one of the great <strong>urban myths of 
		evolutionary biology that there is actual evidence showing the 
		suboptimality of the panda’s pseudothumb</strong>. There is none. When 
		(in March 1990) I asked Stephen Gould himself for the evidence, 
		one-on-one in his office at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at 
		Harvard, he replied that the pseudothumb’s suboptimality was simply 
		obvious. (Gould did not at that meeting, or in any subsequent 
		communications, provide me with any data supporting his opinion. I’ve 
		looked through the literature, and indeed there is none.) It was 
		“obvious” to my wife’s grandmother that our first child would be a boy. 
		“The baby is all in front,” she said, putting her hands on my wife’s 
		tummy late in pregnancy. “A boy, clearly.” On March 16, 1992, Hannah 
		Rachel was born. Comment by <a href="http://www.idthefuture.com">Paul
