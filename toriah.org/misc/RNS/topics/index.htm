		<h3>The Slifkin Affair</h3>
		<p>Some of the more recent discussion may be found at the
		<a href="http://www.toriah.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">wiki</a>.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>In his book <em>Challenge of Creation</em> (2006), Rabbi 
Slifkin claims that there is convincing evidence that the marvels of life are 
due to chance and <strong>naturalistic</strong> processes (such as random 
mutation and natural selection). Given that he accepts the supposed billions of years of 
		fully naturalistic evolution, Rabbi Slifkin,
		<a href="challenge-quotes.htm">in his book</a>, denies the supra-natural 
		creation and historicity of the first man and women (<em>Adam</em> 
and <em>Chava</em>). This contradicts the first chapter of the Torah which 
		describes the creation of <em>Adam</em> at the culmination of the 
		creation week (<em>Adam</em> is created on day six in the image of God). Rather, 
		in <em>Challenge</em>, Rabbi Slifkin argues that the first three chapters of the Torah 
is pretty much a total allegory. Thus, according to <em>Challenge</em>, there was no 
		historical <strong>meta-natural</strong> 
creation week as described in the first chapter of Genesis.</p>
		<p>Some background to such claims. While evolutionists and creationists often debate the 
		scientific evidence for evolution, the source of the ongoing dispute is 
		much deeper. It is not just a clash about gaps in the fossil record or 
		dinosaur bones. Rather, it is a fundamental dispute about different 
		worldviews. </p>
		<p>As Jews we are committed to the 
		absolute truth of the Torah. The universe is the result of a <strong>
		<a href="meta-natural.htm">meta-natural</a></strong> creation solely by 
		Divine fiat, imbued with plan and purpose, so as to bring us to an 
		awareness of the Creator, His wisdom and His kindliness. The first 
		humans (<em>Adam</em> and <em>Chava</em>) were created, in the image of 
		God on the sixth day of the creation week. Thus humans are creatures who 
		are specially blessed with the capacity to discern and choose to live up 
		to these great truths.</p>
		<p>The most influential intellectuals around the world 
		are mostly <strong>naturalists</strong>. They assume that God exists 
		only in the minds of religious believers. The assumption of 
		methodological naturalism – the quasi-religious doctrine that matter and 
		energy is all there is – is the unquestioned assumption that underlies 
		the origin sciences and the intellectual enterprise of western 
		civilization today. For the atheist, if nature is all there is, then 
		chance and natural processes must somehow have the ability to produce 
		the marvels of life. The naturalist is in the unenviable position of, 
		somehow, having 
		to demonstrate that man is here by unguided materialistic processes that 
		did not have him in mind. </p>
		<p>What naturalists actually do is as follows. They start 
		with the <em>assumption</em> that 
		naturalism is true and then, with a limited naturalistic repertoire, 
		they must attempt to provide purely natural and chance explanations for 
		our existence. This is why the origin sciences are based more on 
		unproven and dangerous materialistic presuppositions than empirical 
		verification. The current state and past record of origin sciences as 
		attempts to understand the fundamental nature of reality is a warning 
		that these attempts are 
		<a href="../../../science/evolution/berlinski-darwinian-doubts.htm">speculative 
		and suspect</a>, particularly where they contradict the account of these 
		matters in the Torah.</p>
		<p class="quote_line"><span class="para">Our willingness to accept 
		scientific claims that are <i>against common sense</i> is the key to an 
		understanding of the real struggle between science and the supernatural. 
		We take the side of <i>science</i> in spite of the <i>patent absurdity 
		of some of its constructs</i>, in spite of its failure to fulfill many 
		of its extravagant promises of health and life, in spite of the 
		tolerance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated <i>just-so 
		stories</i>, because we have a prior commitment, a commitment to 
		materialism.</span></p>
		<p class="quote_line">[<span class="para">Richard Lewontin, </span>
		Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard<span class="para">, 
		“Billions and Billions of Demons”, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State
 w:st="on"><i>New York</i></st1:State></st1:place><i> Review of Books</i>, Vol. 
		44, 1997. Emphasis added.]</span></p>
		<p>The consequence of the absurd constructs and &quot;unsubstantiated just so stories&quot; of 
		evolutionary naturalism is moral Darwinism. As <a href="darwin-and-genocide.htm">Michael 
		Ruse</a> puts it: <font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-CA">&quot;The time has come to 
take seriously the fact that we humans are modified monkeys, not the favored 
		Creation of a Benevolent G</span>o<span lang="EN-CA">d on the Sixth Day.</span>&quot; According to this 
		worldview, truth and ethics is relative and culturally constructed.</font></p>
		<p>It is unfortunate that Rabbi Slifkin has aligned 
		himself with the evolutionary naturalists (see the
		<a href="darwin-and-genocide.htm">Ruse</a> quote) while struggling to argue that there is a God 
		behind evolution's random processes, vestigial organs, embryological debris and 
		the <a href="Challenge-303-Panda.htm">poorly designed Panda's thumb</a>. His acceptance of naturalism over 
		Torah has led him to write books <span class="style1"><span class="para">
		that &quot;<a href="rabbis.htm">were deemed to contain ideas antithetical to 
		Torah</a>&quot;</span></span>. His attempted reconciliation 
		(undoubtedly sincerely advanced) to the Challenge of Creation is 
		unnecessary, evasive, and not even acceptable to the leading 
		evolutionary scientists, as can be seen from the following colorful response by the late William Provine 
		(Cornell). </p>
			<p class="quote_line">Some scientists along with many liberal 
			theologians suggest that God set up the universe in the beginning 
			and/or works through the laws of nature. This silly way of trying to 
			have one’s cake and eat it too … is equivalent to the claim that 
			science and religion are compatible if the religion is effectively 
			indistinguishable from atheism.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> </p>
			<p class="quote_line">First, modern science directly implies that the 
			world is organized strictly in accordance with mechanistic 
			principles. There are no purposive principles whatsoever in nature. 
			There are no gods and no designing forces that are rationally 
			detectable. Second, modern science directly implies that there are 
			no inherent moral or ethical laws, no absolute guiding principles 
			for human society. The conflict between science and religion is to 
			the extent that persons who manage to retain religious beliefs while 
			accepting evolutionary biology have to check their brains at the 
			church-house door.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> </p>
			<p class="quote_line">“Evolution is the greatest engine of atheism ever 
			invented”.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> </p>
		<p>&nbsp;Our <em>mesora</em> is not negotiable. It is the 
		worldview that is right, makes sense and has the most evidence on its 
		side. Despite that, it is losing the fight for the public imagination, 
		and those who try to challenge the unproven presuppositions of 
		naturalism are stereotyped as stupid fundamentalists. But this 
		characterization depends upon 
		<a href="../../../operation-science-vs-origins-science/index.htm">
		misinformation, myths</a> and outright trickery. This site explores 
		these issues further.</p>
