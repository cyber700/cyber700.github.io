  <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">You and he maintained a dialogue 
  on the Aishdas website prior to the ban on your books. Apparently you made a 
  claim regarding a <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">haskama</SPAN></I> you 
  received from R&#8217; Sholom Kamenetsky which prompted Dr. Ostroff to post the 
  following letter from R&#8217; Sholom.</SPAN></FONT></P>

  <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Thank you for the note. My name 
  does appear in his book and a careful reading of the <I><SPAN 
  style="FONT-STYLE: italic">haskomo</SPAN></I> will show that I gave no 
  <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">haskomo</SPAN></I> on the content. What 
  impressed me about the book is its science. The uninitiated unlettered Jew 
  often finds that the responses he gets when he questions the seeming 
  incompatibility between science and Torah (l'havdil) are lacking. <BR><BR>The 
  science in the book is impressive, but I do not agree with the positions he 
  takes in the Torah. True, he has "unconventional" sources that would lend some 
  credibility to the theories he proposes, but I see these as "suggestions" 
  (based on somewhat spurious understandings of unconventional sources) that are 
  to allow the uninitiated to feel that he can begin learning Torah, and see for 
  himself that the issues are irrelevant. More than anything else, RNS should be 
  lauded for trying his best to defend the Torah against a group of apikorsim 
  that are bent on mocking Torah and disseminating science as the "proof" that 
  Torah is false, Rachmono litzlan. But to say that these theories have 
  credibility as Torah positions was not my intent in my letter of approbation. 
  I agree with Rabbi Bechofer and there is no such thing as scientific evidence 
  which is "incontrovertible".</SPAN></FONT></P>

  <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN

  <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN

  caused me some personal harm by publicizing the letter from Rav Sholom shlita. 
  You might wonder what could possibly be wrong with doing so. Of this I will 
  say no more at this point, but if you think about the potential circumstances 
  under which he wrote it, you might think of reasons why it was 
  inappropriate.</SPAN></FONT></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><BR>You may feel that you want to 
  make some sort of public apology for either or both of these errors. 
  Unfortunately this could even make things worse, by drawing more attention to 
  the entire matter. The problem with this matter, as one Rosh Yeshivah told me 
  privately, is that there are zealots who tend to overreact when it is 
  discussed, and therefore it must be handled with great 
  care.&#8221;<BR><BR></SPAN></FONT></P>
  <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN

  <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&#8220;I would have thought that the 
  onus would be on you to retract your statement that your allegories had the 
  haskama of Rabbi Kamenetsky, now that we see that he disagrees with your 
  representation of his position.<BR><BR>Since you accuse me of wronging you and 
  "adam karov leatzmo", I consulted with my Rav (Rabbi Shlomo Miller Shlita) who 
  is the Rosh Kollel of the Lakewood Kollel here in Toronto.<BR><BR>Rabbi Miller 
  told me to tell you in his name that it was a mitzva to publicize Rabbi Sholom 
  Kamenetsky's letter. The Tanna Rabbi Shimon Haamsoni retracted on all his 
  derashos when he came to "es Hashem Elokecha tira" and he stated that just as 
  he received reward for darshening so he will be rewarded for retracting. As 
  Rabbi Kamenetsky writes, there are some good things in your books, but he 
  cannot agree with the positions you have taken on the Torah.<BR><BR>If you 
  would like to speak this over in more detail by phone, or when you visit NY 
  after Succos, please be in touch.<BR><BR>With friendship ....

  <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Subsequent to the aforesaid 
  interchange, Dr. Ostroff has not received any communication from you regarding 
  this matter. In fact, I understand you dropped off the Avodah forum entirely 
  after his aforementioned post to Aishdas.&nbsp;<SPAN

  <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Furthermore, I understand that 
  Rabbi Jacoby, of JEP Toronto, approached you when you were here and offered to 
  broker a meeting between you and Rabbi Miller (including Dr. Ostroff) and you 
  were unresponsive. You claim on your site that you were advised by &#8220;two 
  Canadian rabbis who had prior experience with Rabbi Jacoby and/or Rabbi Miller 
  that the agenda would be anything but dialogue. Instead, they warned, the goal 
  of the meeting would undoubtedly be to browbeat me into submission rather than 
  an open discussion to try to resolve our differences constructively. According 
  to them, this is what had transpired in the past. They both strongly advised 
  me against the meeting. Since at the time I was very emotionally overwrought 
  by the controversy, I took their advice&#8230;&#8221; </SPAN></FONT></P>

  <P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Well, as 
  you write, you &#8220;took their advice&#8221; which means that you chose to refuse 
  communication with your Torontonian critics. The above should be a pretty 
  clear explanation of Dr. Ostroff&#8217;s claim that you cut off dialogue with 
  him.<SPAN class=569252217-28102006><FONT

  <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN

  uncomfortable. As you know, I like to &#8216;stick to the <I><SPAN

  personal issues. However, you <I><SPAN

  debate, and thus I am accommodating you. On the other hand, I&#8217;m not entirely 
  sure I need to insert my response in our &#8216;official&#8217; Word document. I discussed 
  it with Dr. Ostroff and he expressed the following opinion:</SPAN></FONT></P>

  <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN

  unfolding of the events on your website with presentations such as: &#8220;At no 
  stage did I receive any communication from either Dr. Jonathan Ostroff or 
  Rabbi Miller regarding any meeting, nor do I recall receiving any indication 
  that either of them wanted to meet with me. Rather, another person, Rabbi 
  Benjy Jacoby, wrote to me&#8230;&#8221; implying that Dr. Ostroff did not reach out to you 
  or that there was no pre-existing communication between the two of you, he 
  feels I should attach the above response to our document in order to present 
  &#8216;our&#8217; side of the story and demonstrate that a) there was a pre-existing, and 
  even pre-ban, communication between you , b) you cut off contact with him 
  after he posted R&#8217; Sholom&#8217;s letter on Aishdas, and c) an attempt <I><SPAN
