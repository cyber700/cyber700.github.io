<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=blue size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Regarding Rav Miller's 
charge - this is something new that I have never heard before. I have some 
questions on it. If I have understood you correctly, Rav Miller is saying that 
it is heretical to posit that any processed post-Creation are the same as any 
processes during creation.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">That’s not exactly correct. There 
could very well have been contemporary processes which existed during the 
Creation period too. For instance, I imagine some form of gravity existed during 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis</SPAN></I>. Otherwise, the 
cows really would have been jumping over the moon. And although one could argue 
that Hashem maintained all physical processes in an entirely miraculous fashion, 
I see no reason to assume that all processes which were initiated during 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis </SPAN></I>must have been 
different than processes which exist today<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">. 
</SPAN></I>What Rav Miller means is that the Creative force, referred to as 
‘<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maamar Hashem</SPAN></I>’, was the force 
which <U>caused</U> all of these processes to materialize and that this force no 
longer exists in the post-Creation period. If you and I jumped into a time 
machine and took a trip back to, say, the sixth day of creation just before Adam 
haRishon was created, I imagine we would probably see a fully formed planet 
teeming with life. We would probably see the sun shining, the wind blowing, the 
trees beginning to blossom, and if we didn’t watch our step, might find 
ourselves being chased down by a T-Rex or being eyed from above by a hungry 
Pterodactyl. However, at the same time, we would probably be subjected to all 
kinds of weird experiences as the Creative force continued to generate new 
processes and the universe continued to “expand”. The bottom line is, it’s just 
impossible to know precisely what was going on during <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis</SPAN></I> because we lack an 
absolute frame of reference which would enable us to make definitive 
statements.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=blue size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Does this mean that 
scientific theories as to how the sun, moon and earth were formed (regardless of 
the time duration) are by definition heretical, since such processes are said to 
still occur?</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This is a tricky question. The 
answer is yes and no. Yes it would be heretical to theorize that the sun, the 
moon and the earth formed due to naturalistic processes which exist today. No it 
would not be heretical to posit theories about the unfolding of the cosmos if 
one claimed that they are not able to be duplicated in a post-Creation scenario. 
However, the latter claim is bordering on the incoherent and thus meaningless. 
All theorists today utilize contemporary scientific principles to trace a 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">naturalistic</SPAN></I> pathway from the Big 
Bang down to sliced bread. I know of no scientist who claims that he is merely 
advancing a possible scenario for the unfolding of the cosmos while 
simultaneously maintaining that this scenario is entirely inimitable from the 
standpoint of contemporary science. Thus, anyone aligned with origins type 
theories is, for all intents and purposes, aligned with <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">kefira</SPAN></I>.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=blue size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">And does it mean that 
it is heretical (as opposed to merely mistaken) to believe in the current or 
recent spontaneous generation of animals from dirt, since according to the 
peshat of Bereishis, that is what happened on the sixth day of 
Creation?</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">No it would not. However, before I 
answer your question, I’d like to make a slight digression. There are two 
elements to your question above. The first is your <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">ikar kasha,</SPAN></I> which is, if the Creative 
process no longer exists, is it <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">kefira</SPAN></I> to postulate the existence of 
spontaneous generation which, seemingly, would be a function of the Creative 
force. The second element of your question is your ostensible differentiation 
between spontaneous generation and any other biological system which draws its 
existence and nourishment directly from the earth. And although this has nothing 
to do with Rav Miller’s <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">shita</SPAN></I> per 
se, I’d like to discuss it for a couple of paragraphs. </SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">When distinguishing between the 
concept of <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">neis</SPAN></I> and <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">teva</SPAN></I>, Rav Dessler invokes some compelling 
imagery to illustrate his point. Suppose we took a corpse, buried it in a grave 
and waited until it decomposed and turned to dust. After some time, we would 
open the grave only to find a fully-grown human being which had developed from 
the earth by means of the remains of the old one. Surely we would refer to this 
as a <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">neis</SPAN></I> akin to <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">techiyas haMeisim</SPAN></I>. However, when we 
observe plant life growing from the ground, we refer to this as <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">teva</SPAN></I>. Why should this be? Horticulturists 
don’t know <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">why</SPAN></I> organic material 
sprouts from the ground when seeds are planted, they just know that it does. Why 
are we any more surprised that it would work with humans? </SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The truth is, this idea applies 
equally to all branches of science. Just as horticulturists can’t tell you why 
the earth responds to the genetic material in a seed, or why items like apples 
and bananas appear from the earth in the first place, zoologists can’t tell you 
why cows or sheep which ingest nothing more than grass and water are capable of 
producing milk, meat, leather, wool and a host of other materials that are 
entirely unrelated to grass. Any of the principles outlined in the most advanced 
scientific textbooks are nothing more than descriptions of processes based on 
empirical observation but they can never presume to reveal the reason <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">why</SPAN></I> these principles function. (Actually, 
you made a similar point in Challenge chapter two when discussing aspects of the 
universe such as its order, its ability to be expressed in mathematical terms, 
its beauty and its sheer comprehensibility. You write “We take order for 
granted. We have been brought up with concepts of laws of nature. To us, it is 
obvious that the universe should make sense. But Einstein considered it 
“miraculous” that the universe evinces order”.) </SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Rav Dessler answers that in truth, 
there is no difference. <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Teva</SPAN></I> is 
actually a <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">neis</SPAN></I> (or, to 
paraphrase Rav Dessler’s classic terminology, “a manifestation of Hashem’s 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ratzon</SPAN></I> as expressed in His 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">hanhaga</SPAN></I> of the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">beriah</SPAN></I>); the difference is, <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">teva</SPAN></I> is the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ratzon</SPAN></I> Hashem we are accustomed to whereas 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">neis</SPAN></I> is the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ratzon</SPAN></I> Hashem we are not accustomed to 
(MME Vol. 1 - pg.177).</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Now, getting back to your <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">ikar kasha</SPAN></I>, as far as I’m concerned, it 
really has nothing to do with spontaneous generation per se because all life 
systems are equally miraculous. Your question can be asked about <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">any</SPAN></I> of the phenomena of the universe. Why 
do trees grow? Why do plants come out of the ground? Why does the solar system 
function etc. All of these elements are discussed in <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis </SPAN></I>and thus your question 
applies equally to all of them i.e. why are they not a contradiction to the idea 
that the Creative force of <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh 
bereishis</SPAN></I> no longer exists in the post-Creation period? 
</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">However, in view of what we’ve been 
saying all along, the answer to your question is simple. The reason why (the 
apparently erroneous notion of) spontaneous generation (or any current process 
for that matter), has nothing to do with <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis</SPAN></I> is because during 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis</SPAN></I> Hashem, acting 
in the role of <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Boreh</SPAN></I>, first 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">initiated</SPAN></I> such laws. He first 
caused them to come into existence from a prior state of non-existence. These 
laws simply didn’t exist before Hashem decreed that they should. So for 
instance, when Hashem created the law that apple seeds, when planted in the 
ground, should cause the earth to yield apple trees, the genetic information 
encoded on the DNA helix of an apple seed can now act as a means for the 
production of apples. However, before Hashem decreed that the earth should 
respond to the DNA apparatus in the seed, one could plant seeds ‘<I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">fun heint biz morgen</SPAN></I>’ and nothing would 
happen. The same applies to spontaneous generation. If let’s say <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">kinim min ha’ipush</SPAN></I> was actually true, then 
we would say that obviously Hashem initiated a law during the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">sheshes yimey bereishis</SPAN></I> which allowed for 
lice from dirt. However, and here’s the main point, there is <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">absolutely no parallel whatsoever 
</SPAN></I>&nbsp;between the process of <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">kinim min ha’ipush</SPAN></I> and the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maamar</SPAN></I> Hashem of “<I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">vayomer Elokim, tadshey ha’aretz desheh”</SPAN></I> 
(Bereishis 1:11) or “<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">vaYomer Elokim totzey 
ha’aretz nefesh chaya</SPAN></I>” (Bereishis 1:24) because <B><SPAN 
style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">whereas the latter two are commands by Hashem to 
<U>initiate</U> the process, the former example is ‘merely’ the ongoing <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">dvar</SPAN></I> Hashem (<I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">l’olam Hashem d’varcha nitzav bashamayim</SPAN></I> – 
Tehilim 119) to <U>perpetuate</U> a <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">pre-existing</SPAN></I> process via the agency of 
‘<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">teva’, </SPAN></I>a euphemism which really 
refers to the <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Ratzon</SPAN></I> Hashem as 
expressed in His role as <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Manhig</SPAN></I>.</SPAN></B></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Incidentally, this explains the 
Rambam’s <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">shita</SPAN></I> in Pirkey Avos. 
The Rambam holds that all miracles which occur in <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">teva</SPAN></I> were pre-programmed during the period 
of <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis</SPAN></I>. In view of 
Rav Miller’s explanation, this Rambam is <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">lichtig</SPAN></I>! Of course<I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic"> </SPAN></I>all miracles must be pre-programmed; the 
Creative process was permanently suspended with the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">amirah</SPAN></I> of <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Dai</SPAN></I>, enough. Consequently, nothing new can 
possibly materialize during the post-Creation period.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=blue size=2><SPAN

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Rabbi Slifkin, I think I’ve done the 
best I possibly can to elucidate Rav Miller’s <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">shita</SPAN></I>. I hope my presentation was 
satisfactory. Incidentally, I don’t expect you to agree with me at this point 
(although I can’t think of anything that would delight me more). My primary 
issues at this time are</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">a) That you understand Rav Miller’s 
concern </SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">b) I’ve been sufficiently clear in

</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=blue size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The essential objection 
sounds no different to that of the Lubavitcher Rebbe regarding why he believed 
it to be kefirah to say that the six days were longer than 24 hours. Rav 
Carmell's answer, on. p. 182 of my book, would be equally 
applicable.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This is incorrect. Rav Miller’s 
point has nothing to do with the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s point although both are 
equally valid. The Lubavitcher Rebbe’s point is that the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">sheshes yimey bereishis</SPAN></I> must mean literal 
days as opposed to periods because otherwise, why do we celebrate Shabbos on the 
seventh <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">day. </SPAN></I>Rav Miller does not 
treat this idea directly although he certainly does relate to the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">sheshes yimey bereishis</SPAN></I> as six days, not 
periods. Rav Miller’s point is that even if we were to accept the various 
day-age theories out there, it could only be within the context of a Creation 
period scenario. Any theory which utilizes contemporary laws of nature as a 
means of describing the unfolding of nature is <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">kefira</SPAN></I>, plain and simple. So, although 
both the Lubavitcher Rebbe and Rav Miller may both reject reinterpreting 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">sheshes yimey bereishis </SPAN></I>as time 
periods<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">, </SPAN></I>they do so for different 
reasons.<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic"> </SPAN></I>The Lubavitcher Rebbe

there was a ten page refutation of my paper issued by several professors which

seventh day’ must remain forever beyond our comprehension, whether the days are 
taken literally or metaphorically. It is reasonably clear that the Torah wishes 
to convey that the six weekdays and Shabbat correspond to some basic structures 
of reality, and it can make no difference to the concept of Shabbat whether 
God’s ‘activity’ or ‘inactivity’ is expressed in relation to days, sephirot, or 
other spiritual constructs.</SPAN></FONT></P>

“Nor by the Rambam, who held that the six days were not time-periods at all” 
slip by without protesting. I won’t revisit the multitude of sources I 
delineated in this communication other than to mention that I consider responses 
such as “it is well known that there are numerous contradictions between the Yad 
and the Moreh, reflecting the different contexts in which they were written. And 
regarding the seeming contradictions in the Moreh itself - Rambam himself, in 
his introduction, states that there will be seemingly conflicting statements” 
(made by you earlier in this dialogue) to be entirely inadequate. Even if you 
were correct, it could never apply to such a clearly and repeatedly stated 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">shita</SPAN></I> of the Rambam.

mean by “Just as people have different understandings of what it means that 
Hashem redeemed us from Egypt with a strong hand”. If you are referring to the 
Ra’avad who argues with the Rambam regarding anthropomorphism, the Ra’avad never 
meant to say that someone has the right to understand <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">yitziyas mitrayim</SPAN></I> in that fashion <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">chs’v</SPAN></I>. He merely meant to negate the 
Rambam’s classification of <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">min</SPAN></I> 
regarding this belief. The belief of <I><SPAN

point is that people are attesting that Hashem made the entire universe, not 
exactly how He did and how long it took”. I would like to point out that this is 
precisely what we’ve been speaking about all along. You may believe this to be 
so but Rav Miller and others understand the main point to include the 
understanding that the universe and all its imperatives could not have unfolded 
naturally but rather must have been created via a meta-natural fiat of an 
infinite Creator. This applies whether you hold that <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">sheshes yimey bereishis</SPAN></I> took six days or 
was all created instantly. Thus, although you may wish to contest this point, it 
doesn’t rate an offhanded ‘besides’.</SPAN></FONT></P>

style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: green">While I’m at it, I’d like to mention my 
own personal <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">shita</SPAN></I> in this 
matter. If one maintains that the world is able to unfold via naturalistic 
pathways, he has effectively written Hashem out of the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">beriah. </SPAN></I>Richard Dawkins and Douglas 
Futuyma observe (i.e. see) precisely the same laws of nature as you do and come 
to the inexorable conclusion that the universe is godless. What gives you, or 
anyone, the right to introduce Godliness into a scenario which can be entirely 
imputed to chance? The answer is, nothing! It is only when one studies the 
phenomena of nature, <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">all</SPAN></I> of the 
phenomena of nature, and detects the endless wisdom in all of their components, 
that one can then detect the presence of a Creator from His creations. By 
adopting the <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">shita</SPAN></I> that the world 
evolved via naturalistic means which Hashem was somehow manipulating in the 
background, one severely compromises the ability of mankind to reach the 
awareness of Hashem from His <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">beriah. 
</SPAN></I>And since our ultimate <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">tachlis</SPAN></I> is the awareness of Hashem, and 
one of the fundamental ways of attaining this awareness is through studying the 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">beriah</SPAN></I>, adopting your <I><SPAN

<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">tachlis haBeriah</SPAN></I>. As a leading 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">posek</SPAN></I>, Rav Miller is zeroing in 
on the <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">halachic</SPAN></I> aspects of 
adopting your <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">shita</SPAN></I>. I, on the 
other hand, am not concerned as much about the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">halachic</SPAN></I> ramifications as I am regarding 
the <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">hashkafic</SPAN></I> drawbacks and as 
such, I see the elimination of the facility of awareness from an observation of 
the <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">beriah</SPAN></I> as the most egregious 
element of adopting your suggestions. </SPAN></FONT></P>

I wish to be milamed zchus on the Rav (Rambam) and all those who maintain his 
approach in that which they interpreted the parsha in an allegorical fashion 
(derech tziyuri v’hamshalayee) and it (the limud zechus) is that as far as the 
commands and laws of the Torah are concerned, it never entered their minds to 
allegorize the verses G-d forbid because anything [which appears in the Torah] 
which is associated with an action (a maaseh) was accepted by them and their 
progeny to keep and to do. And so too, in the episode of maaseh bereishis which 
occurred during the six days, the Rav [Rambam] did not compose an [allegorical] 
interpretation and did not veer from the literal interpretation of the pesukim 
as the Torah describes it inasmuch as the belief of Chiddush haOlam is accepted 
amongst our nation. However, when discussing the episode of the Trees of Gan 
Eden, the formation of Woman from the [Adam’s] side, and the episode of the 
snake, it did enter their minds to reinterpret the verses etc.”

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We see two things here. Firstly we 
see that the Abarbanel was <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">chozer</SPAN></I> 
from characterizing the Rambam as taking the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">pesukim</SPAN></I> of <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">perek aleph</SPAN></I> in Bereishis allegorically. 
And second of all, we gain insight into the difference between the first and 
second <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">perek</SPAN></I> of Bereishis. The 
first, claims the Abarbanel, is akin to a regular <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">mitzvah ma’asis</SPAN></I> because since Chiddush 
haOlam is a <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">yesod</SPAN></I> which is 
universally accepted by our nation, it has the din of a <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">mitzvah ma’asis</SPAN></I>. Thus, just as the Rambam 
would never allegorize a mitzvah, so too, he would never allegorize any of the 
pesukim in <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">perek aleph</SPAN></I> of 
Bereishis. On the other hand, the story of the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">nachash</SPAN></I> is not one of the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">yesodey haEmuna</SPAN></I> and thus the Rambam felt 
he had licence to allegorize it if necessary.<FONT color=blue><SPAN

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=red size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Again, in light of the 
fact that Abarbanel did earlier (on p. 10) ascribe this view to Rambam, and he 
attested that other commentaries had revealed this to be Rambam's true view, and 
he said that Rambam had ingeniously tried to conceal this view, it makes no 
sense that he would now believe that Rambam never actually held such a view 
after all, without addressing what he had said earlier.</SPAN></FONT></P>

ro’os</SPAN></I>. If you have a <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">kasha</SPAN></I> on the Abarbanel’s style, so be it. 
But it doesn’t detract from the plain meaning of his words here. I have spoken 
to several people regarding this issue and I understand that this could very 
well be characteristic of the Abarbanel’s style of writing. I could have 
mentioned this to you before but I chose not to because I can’t back it up 
sufficiently. But even a cursory reading of the first 100 pages of the Abarbanel 
on <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">chumash</SPAN></I> Bereishis reveals a 
unique style of writing which needs to be taken into consideration when 
determining precisely his meaning. But once again, I am not appealing to 
“writing styles” as a proof to my reading of the Abarbanel; only the plain 
meaning of his words, as is my <I><SPAN

style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What, then, is going on 
with pages 85+? The answer is that Abarbanel is addressing Aristotelian-type 
allegories which are a million miles&nbsp;from pshat. When you quote the 
statement of Abarbanel that "the Rav [Rambam] did not compose an [allegorical] 
interpretation and did not veer from the literal interpretation of the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">pesukim</SPAN></I> as the Torah describes it…" you 
have omitted the end of the sentence! The full sentence is as follows: "the Rav 
[Rambam] did not compose an [allegorical] interpretation and did not veer from 
the literal interpretation of the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">pesukim</SPAN></I> as the Torah describes it in that 
the belief in chiddush ha-olam (the non-Aristotelian view of the world) is 
accepte with our nation." That is what he is stressing that Rambam did not 
allegorize. The non-sequential order of days is small fry that doesn't affect 
things so much - Rambam still maintains that Hashem created 
everything.</SPAN></FONT></P>

the bizarre behaviour of the Abarbanel, I don’t see it as such a problem

time around, the Abarbanel wanted to make a strong point of rejecting allegory 
in <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis</SPAN></I>. Since he 
understood that the Ralbag and Narboni attributed the allegorical approach to 
the Rambam and relied on him for its validity, he used the Rambam as the outlet 
for all of his irritation against the <I><SPAN

making an attempt to determine if the Rambam himself was indeed allegorizing. 
Later on, as he was writing his <I><SPAN

advance your allegorical approach to <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh

understood the unfolding of the universe (i.e. <I><SPAN

years. Even if we were to adopt the allegorical approach, it simply means that 
the universe was created instantly rather than six physical days. Recent 
Creation is not anywhere contested amongst <I><SPAN

the Moreh itself - Rambam himself, in his introduction, states that there will 
be seemingly conflicting statements! As Abarbanel pointed out, this approach to 
the six days was one of Rambam's great secrets which he concealed with 
ingenuity. It seems that Crescas missed it.&nbsp;If you want to understand how

her book and truthfully, I am unimpressed. She does precisely the same you do 
with the Abarbanel i.e. ignore his mitigating comments on page 86 (page 248 in 
her book – Hebrew Edition), quotes Narboni (page 246) and Shem Tov (page 247 -

Shem Tov on page 249 but the thrust of her <I><SPAN

quoting her doesn’t do much for me. I would much quicker accept the opinion of a

spirit of friendly Torah debate, I’d like to ask you a question. How can you 
possibly say that it is "impossible" to think that Rambam possessed this view, 
in light of the fact that Abarbanel, Shem Tov, Narvoni and Akeidas Yitzchak all 
ascribe this view to Rambam? I would like to suggest my own answer to this 
question. It seems clear that you believe that the belief in a literal six days 
is a very, very important part of Judaism, and that you have made teaching this 
into your own personal mission. So perhaps you would simply be unable to accept 
under any circumstances that Rambam&nbsp;could have held differently? After all, 
since you do&nbsp;believe that Rambam was a tremendous Gaon and 
tzaddik,&nbsp;you presumably consider it impossible that he would subscribe to 
heretical views.&nbsp;In which case there is no point in our debating this 
issue. (In contrast, i would have no problem if it somehow turned out that this 
was not Rambam's view; I presented this approach in The Science Of Torah even 
before knowing that it was Rambam's view.) Unless you can give me reason to 
think otherwise, this debate would appear to be futile, from my 
perspective.</SPAN></FONT></P>

I’ll let you decide that for yourself. Suffice to say that you have a lot more

accuse you of intellectual bias; I expect the same treatment from you. In your

reasonable people and if Dr. Ostroff and I attempted to explain Rav Miller’s 
shita, you would attempt to understand. I took you at your word and ask that you

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=blue size=2><SPAN lang=EN-US 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I have two comments 
regarding your response below. Firstly, the paper that is being prepared is, for 
the most part, a general review of the sources you delineate in your books, both 
Torah and science, whereas Rav Miller’s argument is much more focused and deals 
directly with the <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">kefira</SPAN></I> aspect 
of the naturalistic approach to <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh 
bereishis. </SPAN></I>Consequently, his <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">shita</SPAN></I> stands independent of any papers RJO 
or I intend to release. As such, it would be nice to see some sort of response 
from you regarding this issue for, as you write, there seems to be “thousands of 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">erliche</SPAN></I> Jews” that have adopted 
your opinions and thus it is quite <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">nogeah</SPAN></I> to come to a final determination 
regarding this particular issue.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=blue size=2><SPAN lang=EN-US 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">My second comment 
involves your response to the issue of the Abarbanel. Assuming for the time 
being that you are correct and that the contrast between the first and second 
quote in the Abarbanel seems inexplicable, why didn’t you quote both sources in 
your book? After all, the Abarbanel says clearly in the second quote that the 
Rambam did not make a <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">mashal</SPAN></I> or 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">tzura</SPAN></I> of <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis</SPAN></I>. Furthermore, the 
Abarbanel states openly in Moreh Nevuchim (2:31) that <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis</SPAN></I> is not a <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">mashal</SPAN></I> and ties it into Shabbos. I would 
have expected to have seen all the sources in the Abarbanel quoted, pro and con. 
This way your readers can be fully apprised of the situation.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=blue size=2><SPAN lang=EN-US 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">However, as it happens, 
I have a response to your <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">ikar 
ta’ana</SPAN></I>. You write as follows: “</SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial 
color=blue size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Considering that he 
explains Rambam's position on the non-chronological sequence with very 
definitive language, then procedes to sharply dispute it, it is most 
unreasonable to think that SIXTY-SEVEN pages later he has decided that Rambam 
didn't really hold that view at all without explicitly spelling that out.” The 
problem is, he <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">does</SPAN></I> spell it out, 
very clearly. On page 85 he revisits the whole literal versus allegorical 
approach controversy which he discussed in the first <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">perek</SPAN></I>. He then makes a tally of the 
literalists versus allegorists with Rashi and the Ramban on the right and the 
Rambam and Ralbag on the left and even revisits his criticism against the Rambam 
(what will the Rambam answer to Hashem when He asks him how he felt justified in 
interpreting <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis</SPAN></I> as 
a <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">mashal</SPAN></I> and <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">tzura</SPAN></I>) but then he <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">qualifies</SPAN></I> (as opposed to contradicts) his 
criticism and states that the Rambam was only making a <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">mashal</SPAN></I> and <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">tzura</SPAN></I> of certain elements in the 
<U>second</U> <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">perek</SPAN></I> of Bereishis 
such as the <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">nachash</SPAN></I> or the 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">eitz ha’daas</SPAN></I>. However, as far as 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis</SPAN></I> as described in 
the first <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">perek</SPAN></I> of Bereishis “the 
Rav [Rambam] did not compose an [allegorical] interpretation and did not veer 
from the literal interpretation of the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">pesukim</SPAN></I> as the Torah describes it 
[<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis</SPAN></I>]… (pg. 86 first 
column 15 lines up). Hence, there is no contradiction between the Abarbanel’s 
criticism on page ten and his statements on page 86. He is not being <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">chozer</SPAN></I> from his criticism on page ten; nor 
is he being <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">chozer</SPAN></I> from his 
position that the Rambam allegorized certain elements. The only <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">chazara</SPAN></I> pertains to <U>which</U> elements 
he allegorized. Thus, the juxtaposition of these two sources in the Abarbanel is 
perfectly reasonable.</SPAN></FONT></P>

same lines, the Rambam writes: “From amongst the things that you must very much 
contemplate is that it (the Torah) mentions the creation of man in the six days 
of creation and it states “He created them male and female”. It concludes [the 
episode of] all of creation and states “And the heavens and earth were completed 
and all of their hosts”. After this it relates another beginning to the creation 
of [Adam and Chava and states that] Chava [came] from Adam, and it mentions the 
tree of life and tree of knowledge, and the story of the snake and what 
occurred, and it makes (i.e. establishes) that all this occurred after Adam was 
placed in Gan Eden. All of the wise men, may their memory be blessed, concur 
that this episode occurred on the sixth day [of creation] and that nothing will 
change after the six days of creation, and therefore none of the things from 
amongst those we mentioned [above] are distant (i.e. farfetched) because the 
laws of nature were not crystallized as of yet.” (Moreh 2:30 - Kapach ed. pg.

states in Moreh Nevuchim that every episode related in the Torah is there for 
one of two purposes. Either it is there to reinforce a <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">hashkafa</SPAN></I> which relates to one of the 
fundamentals of the Torah, or it appears in the Torah as a form of <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">tikun olam, </SPAN></I>a societal infrastructure 
which facilitates harmony amongst mankind. If so, asks the Rambam, what is the 
purpose of all the generations listed between Adam haRishon and Avraham Avinu? 
Here’s the Rambam’s response: “Since it is a fundamental doctrine of the Torah 
that the world is newly created and that the first [human] creation was Adam and 
that the time which elapsed from Adam to Moshe is approximately 2,500 
years…etc.” and the Rambam goes on to explain that anyone viewing such a 
diversified world with so many inhabitants belonging to so many different 
cultures speaking so many different languages spread out over such large 
geographical locations, might doubt the recentness of creation and the fact that 
initially, only one man was created. Therefore, the Torah goes out of its way to 
list the specific generations which unfolded from Adam to Moshe, who their 
leaders were, what occurred to them, and that they originally all spoke one 
language as one would expect from a society which descended from one lone man

Adam and Chava are also to be understood allegorically (Challenge of Creation pg

your allegorical hat (Challenge pgs 108-110) and in fact you spend several pages

the idea that during the creative process the universe continued to expand “like

said “dai”, enough, and established the final limitations of physical law. What 
emerges from this maamar Chazal is as follows: </SPAN></FONT></P>

universe; the “Creation” period and the “post-Creation” period. During the 
Creation period, as the laws of nature were first being brought into existence, 
they remained in a constant state of flux. This represented the period of 
Creation. Subsequently, Hashem said “dai” and “reigned in the expansion”, that 
is, he stabilized the laws of nature such that they became static, 
unchanging.</SPAN></FONT></P>

process was permanently suspended and the laws of nature permanently fixed. 
Shabbos is a commemoration of this idea as the <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">pasuk</SPAN></I> states (Shmos 20:10)… why have I 
commanded you to keep the Shabbos on the seventh day?&nbsp; “<I><SPAN

affair but lasted a duration of time referred to as <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">sheshes yamim </SPAN></I>and we celebrate Shabbos on 
the seventh day to commemorate this event.</SPAN></FONT></P>

style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">There are two ramifications that surface from the 
above-stated idea. a) The creative process cannot be duplicated in a 
post-Creation period. b) Attempting to reconcile post-Creation imperatives with 
the fundamental dynamics of the Creation period is essentially impossible. In 
Rav Miller’s opinion, advancing a theory which contravenes the first 
ramification by conflating these two distinct periods is considered a 
fundamental kefira in Shabbos whereas attempting to reconcile phenomena which 
appear to contradict the Torah by positing, say, day-age theories, in opposition 
to the second ramification, does not constitute kefira.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Allow me to explain. When you 
conclude that “Naturalistic Darwinian evolution is fully compatible with 
religion” (Challenge of Creation pg. 294) or that “the blind-watchmaker thesis 
need not be incompatible with G-d” (Science of Torah pg. 193; Challenge of 
Creation pg. 297) you have in essence contravened the first of the two 
ramifications above. The reason is because evolution is a purely naturalistic 
process (albeit guided by G-d) which can, and currently is being duplicated in 
the post-Creation period. The problem is, ramification (a) states that the 
creation process is unable to be duplicated via the normal <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">chukey haTeva</SPAN></I> which obtain in the 
post-Creation period without a specialized <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">ma’amar</SPAN></I> Hashem to activate this process. 
When we celebrate Shabbos, we are testifying to the idea that the world came 
about via a unique, meta-natural creative process which is entirely removed from 
the current <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">chukey haTeva</SPAN></I>. We are 
affirming that the current laws of nature are entirely inadequate as a means of 
bringing about the phenomena of the universe. </SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">You see, the role of “<I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Boreh</SPAN></I>” is entirely different than the role 
of “<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Manhig</SPAN></I>” in the sense that the 
very laws of nature, the imperatives which govern the cosmos, space, time, mass, 
energy, life etc., all this was only able to come into existence via Hashem 
exercising his role as <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Boreh</SPAN></I>. 
Subsequently, He transformed his relationship to the universe from <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Boreh</SPAN></I> to that of <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Manhig</SPAN></I> by suspending the creative process 
and permanently establishing the laws of nature and the fixity of the various 
species of life on earth. These laws continue to be repeated over and over again 
but cannot, under any circumstances, be understood within the context of 
possessing the ability of self-perpetuation. For that, only the role of <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Boreh</SPAN></I> suffices. Thus, by subscribing to 
the evolutionary paradigm which utilizes currently understood laws of nature to 
describe the appearance of all of the species of life on earth, one is 
contravening the idea that these laws are inadequate as a means of perpetuating 
life. It is contravening the idea that only Hashem, functioning in His role as 
Boreh, can possibly bring about life whether plant, animal or human. The same 
issue applies to other theories such as Big Bang cosmology. Since Shabbos was 
established specifically to commemorate this very idea, by subscribing to 
origins theories which utilize post-Creation imperatives, we undermine the very 
essence of Shabbos.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">As far as ramification #2 is 
concerned, Rav Miller feels that if someone wishes to believe that the universe 
is billions of years old and the six day period of <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">maaseh bereishis</SPAN></I> is six time periods, he 
is not undermining Shabbos as long as he believes that these billions of years 
all occurred within the framework of “<I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Beriah</SPAN></I>” which does not utilize currently 
understood laws of nature and thus cannot be duplicated today. As far as Rav 
Miller’s personal position, he believes in a literal six day creation because he 
believes in the <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">messorah</SPAN></I> and sees 
no reason why we must contravene it. This is what he meant by bringing down the 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">ma’amar</SPAN></I> Chazal regarding <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Kayin and Hevel’s</SPAN></I> birth. Since the very 
laws of nature themselves were first being formed during the Creation period, 
any number of random violations of those laws was possible. Thus, what looks to 
us like a billion year universe could conceivably, or rather, theoretically, 
have occurred all within this six day period. The actual truth is entirely 
unknowable because we do not possess a frame of reference by which we can 
compare (as the <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">pasuk</SPAN></I> in <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Iyov</SPAN></I> states “Where were you when I laid 
the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you possess understanding” 38:4) and thus he 
feels that the best course of action is to simply follow the <I><SPAN

style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The Rambam (Hilchos Teshuva 3:7) 
categorizes one who believes that Hashem is corporeal as a ‘Min’, an apostate. 
The Ra’avad has some sharp words for the Rambam and, in our version of the Yad, 
claims as follows: (all translations in this email are my own) “Why did he (the 
Rambam) refer to this person as a Min? Many who were greater and better than the 
Rambam followed this idea (the corporeality of G-d) because of what they saw in 
the verses (of the Torah) and even more so, what they saw in the words of the 
aggados (of the Talmud) which cause a distortion of attitudes in one’s mind (if 
not learned properly)” The Kesef Mishneh protests the Ra’avad’s sharp words but 
essentially agrees with him and points to a much tamer version of the Ra’avad’s 
criticism brought down in the Sefer haIkkarim 1:2. I will hereby translate some 
select portions from that sefer which will clarify Rav Miller’s enigmatic 
psak.</SPAN></FONT></P>

everything stated in the Torah is absolutely true. One who denies something in 
the Torah while simultaneously being aware that the opinion he is denying is 
indeed the view of the Torah, is referred to as a ‘kofer’… however, one who 
upholds the laws of Moses and believes in its fundamentals, and when he comes to 
analyze the Torah from an intellectual perspective or from a perspective of 
biblical analysis, his study leads him to err and to say that one of the 
fundamentals of the Torah is not as it would seem, or his study has caused him

regarding the Abarbanel and Shem Tov. Let’s take the Abarbanel for example. 
Although you are correct that the Abarbanel seems to attribute the hierarchy 
opinion of Creation to the Rambam, this is only his initial impression based on 
the Ralbag and Narboni. This attribution can be found in the Abarbanel’s 
<I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">pirush</SPAN></I> on Chumash Bereishis (1:1) 
question #9. However, in chapter 2, just after question #42, the Abarbanel 
retracts his position and says as follows: </SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=3><SPAN

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 3pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT 
face=Arial size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">"Behold you 
see that the opinion of the Rav (the Rambam) was not that all of MB was an 
allegory, rather, only a small part of it (some elements in the second chapter 
of Bereishis, not the first), and that all which is mentioned [in the 
Torah]&nbsp; regarding the activity of the six days, from the creation of the 
heavens and the earth, and all of the phenomena, and the creation of Adam and 
his wife, up until [the passage of] "v'yichulu", have no allegory whatsoever for 
everything was [understood as] literal to him and therefore you will see that in 
this very chapter, #30 in the second section, in all which the Rav has 
explicated regarding the activity of the six days, he did not make [of MB] an 
allegory or a hint (pirush tzurayi oh remez) at all; rather, he did the exact 
opposite, for he made a concerted effort to support the doctrine of creation ex

states “he did not make [of MB] an allegory or a hint (pirush tzurayi oh remez)

what is described in the verses regarding the six days of creation…and it is 
entirely literal and therefore the seventh day was the day of rest to

yes, Rav Miller would feel that such a position is <I><SPAN

Abarbanel himself, when first attributing the hierarchy position to the Rambam 
says much worse things. For instance, he says “notwithstanding the Rambam’s 
lofty Torah position, his opinion is clearly a lie” (pg 10 second column four 
lines from the bottom) and he accuses the Rambam of “contradicting the verses 
and distorting them” (5 lines later) or he states (pg. 12 second column) “what 
emerges from all this is the absolute nullification of the Rambam’s words and 
opinions in this matter” and he even says “what will the Rambam answer in front 
of the Ribbono shel Olam when he is asked ‘where did you receive the licence to 
make a tzura in some of maaseh bereishis’ etc.” As far as his own <I><SPAN 
style="FONT-STYLE: italic">shita</SPAN></I>, the Abarbanel quotes the Ramban 
“and know that the days mentioned in maaseh bereishis were, in the creation of 
the heaven and earth and their offshoots, real days, composed of hours and 
minutes and they were six, just like the literal meaning of the verses implies…” 
and then the Abarbanel waxes poetic and states “may my soul die the death of the 
righteous and may its end be like his (i.e the Ramban’s).</SPAN></FONT></P>

point by point fashion to your above query and although I personally would like 
to respond I will save my personal opinions for another time. What he did say 
was that you are displaying an improper attitude towards Chazal and when he 
wrote the words “reyach minus” in his first letter, this is what he was 
referring to.<FONT color=blue><SPAN style="COLOR: blue"> </SPAN></FONT>Rav 
Miller feels that this attitude towards Chazal is also what caused you to err in 
the issue of creation. The truth is, I am a bit uncomfortable relating this 
response to you because it falls somewhat outside the parameters of the purely

how he reconciles these views with his</SPAN></FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=3><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">You are misquoting Rav Miller. He 
never said anything about sugyos which contradict science. He said that if one

understand, he should say <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">lo zachisi l’havin 
</SPAN></I>and he brought a ma’amr Chazal to prove this contention. This is most 
certainly a time-honored tradition of all talmeday chachamim although there 
might be scattered incidents in the Gemara where we are unable to follow the 
conclusions of Chazal all the time such as medicine. Besides, he does not 
consider evolution a ‘science’ which contradicts any <I><SPAN

truthfully don’t know what Rav Miller’s opinions are and to be honest, he didn’t

explaining his <I><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">shita</SPAN></I> regarding 
the Shabbos issue and then had to get back to the phone to answer <I><SPAN

perhaps Rav Miller would not consider some of the <I><SPAN
