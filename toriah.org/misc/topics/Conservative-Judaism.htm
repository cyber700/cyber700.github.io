resident of <span class=SpellE>Modi’in</span>, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>. He is also the son of a
Conservative Rabbi, graduate of a Schechter high school and Ramah camp, and was
active in both USY and the <span class=SpellE>Masorti</span> movement in
Israel. The resulting combination of logical thought and imbued dedication to
Jews and Judaism comes out in his latest <span class=SpellE>blog</span> entry,
in which he discusses the same Slate magazine article that came to my attention
last week—but his critique is obviously coming, in his words, from “someone
from within the system.” And his critique is far more scathing than my own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'>The heart of the problem is this: Conservative Judaism
has been a spectacular failure at raising a second generation of committed
laypeople. The movement has produced brilliant thinkers and scholarship,
unparalleled educational programs, and a large number of synagogues. But
membership is declining, and that’s because children who grow up in Conservative
synagogues rarely care much about Jewish observance — and when they do, they
become rabbis, join Orthodox synagogues, or move to Israel.</span></i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'> [<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'>He then goes on to address the decision of the
Conservative movement to allow its members to drive on <span class=SpellE>Shabbos</span>,
implying that this has been the single greatest contributor to the movement’s
decline. This is especially interesting for the following reason. If you would
ask most Orthodox Jews what decision of the Reform movement has created the
greatest fissure between the two, the Orthodox would most likely respond with <span
class=SpellE>patrilineal</span> descent. Thanks to <span class=SpellE>patrilineal</span>
descent, there are now thousands (if not tens of thousands) of Reform Jews who
are not Jewish by traditional standards. If you ask the same question about the
Conservative movement, the Orthodox would likely refer to driving on <span
class=SpellE>Shabbos</span>. This is the decision that told us that, once and
for all, the Conservatives are not interested in following traditional Jewish
law, more than mixed seating and long before the decision to ordain women.
[Rabbi Joel Roth, whose defense of the current policy on homosexuality is one
of two opinions up for debate before the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards,
also called the driving decision “untenable sub specie <span class=SpellE>halachah</span>.”]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'>And there is one other commonality between <span
class=SpellE>patrilineal</span> descent and driving on <span class=SpellE>Shabbos</span>—these
two decisions now stand condemned from within their respective movements as
short-sighted mistakes, with tragic consequences of epic proportions. Each
decision was intended to further Jewish continuity, and has grievously harmed
it instead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'>Why does a nice Jewish boy marry a nice Jewish girl?
Two reasons: 1) he wants to have Jewish kids, and 2) otherwise his mother will
kill him, because she wants Jewish grandkids. Thanks to <span class=SpellE>patrilineal</span>
descent, however, our protagonist no longer needs to marry a Jewish girl in
order to have those Jewish kids. The result is recorded in a note by Daniel <span
class=SpellE>Elazar</span>, then Editor of the Jerusalem Letter of the
Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, inserted into an article by U Penn Prof.
Samuel <span class=SpellE>Klausner</span> called “The Conversion of American
Jewry” and published 15 years ago:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'>The Reform movement itself reports a huge drop in the
number of conversions to Reform Judaism since their acceptance of <span
class=SpellE>patrilineal</span> <span class=SpellE>Jewishness</span>. This
means that there were only a few years in which intermarriage was accompanied
by a substantial number of conversions. When the intermarriage rate began to
grow serious in the late 1960s there were about two decades in which this
phenomenon occurred, until <span class=SpellE>patrilineal</span> descent was
introduced. The Reform movement was performing about 10,000 conversions a year.
Over 13 years this amounted to 130,000 converts, plus Conservative and a few
Orthodox ones. But after the <span class=SpellE>patrilineal</span> decision the
Reform conversion figure dropped to 1,000 a year, a 90 percent drop, because
spouses felt less compelled to convert. Some in the Reform movement now realize
that they shot themselves in the foot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'>Now here is what Lerner has to say about driving on <span
class=SpellE>Shabbos</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'>I am convinced that the Conservative movement’s
decision to allow driving on Shabbat was one of the most short-sighted mistakes
that it ever made. I understand the logic of the decision, which basically
claimed that Jews are moving out to the suburbs, and that if we don’t allow
them to drive to the synagogue on Shabbat, they’ll drop out of Jewish life
entirely. Perhaps that was true, and perhaps it wasn’t. But the effect of this
decision was dramatic: No longer was driving to synagogue on Shabbat something
that was tolerated by the movement for those who were unable to afford nearby
housing. Instead, it became the norm and the default, allowing Jews to move
wherever they wanted, knowing that they would always be able to drive to the
synagogue.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'>I’m not saying that Jews shouldn’t drive on Shabbat. I
have chosen not to, but I have many friends who do, and I respect their
decision. But when most members of a synagogue live within walking distance of
one another, it creates an amazing dynamic that feeds on itself — a positive
feedback loop that strengthens the community. They can invite each other over
for Shabbat and holiday meals. Spending time with one another in this way is a
key ingredient in fostering community. When you visit someone for a Shabbat
meal, you strengthen the ties at many different levels: The kids play together,
the adults get a chance to talk, and newcomers to the community have an
opportunity to meet their new neighbors. At each of the two <span class=SpellE>minyanim</span>
we have attended in the Chicago area, we were greeted not only by friendly
people who welcomed us to their community, but with numerous meal invitations,
at which we managed to form some strong, continuing friendships.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'>When you look at this sort of thing, you realize that
the longevity of the Jewish People is simply not logical. It’s not something
that leaps out at you, but look at what happens to the continuity of the Jewish
nation when someone tries to mess with the formula.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'>Those aiming to “modernize” Jewish behavior used to
defend themselves with a challenge to Torah: how could the Torah, written for a
nomadic tribe wandering the deserts of the Middle East, possibly deal with an
era of modern transportation, digital communications, and unparalleled acceptance
by the surrounding non-Jewish population? But it is now clear that when
contemporary devoted Jews attempt to change the Torah’s rules to better address
those very phenomena, the result is exactly the opposite of their aim. When
they try to make the Torah respond better to the needs of modern Jews, they end
up reducing Jewish affiliation and harming Jewish continuity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'>Now whether or not we can criticize these decisions
with 20/20 hindsight, the assemblies of Conservative and Reform Rabbis are not
composed of fools, and they are only making their best efforts to keep their
movements thriving and vibrant in today’s world. Could you or I do better? I
don’t know about you, but I’d be the last to claim that I could. And it’s
obvious, I think, that no individual or group could possibly have responded
better to today’s world, if they were building a system for Jewish life in
total ignorance of these modern phenomena, thousands of years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'>That leaves us with two possibilities. One is that the
design of the traditional system for Jewish life is the most serendipitous
event in world history. The other, of course, is that it was composed by no
individual or group, but rather by a Higher Intelligence. Neither could be
described as anything less than a miracle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Cross-Currents, but wonder what people will say about the referenced article—given
that it was written neither by myself nor any Orthodox Jew, but by Samantha

kicked off his retirement with a graduation speech that was the religious
scholar’s equivalent of <span class=SpellE>Zinedine</span> <span class=SpellE>Zidane’s</span>
World Cup head-butt. <span class=SpellE>Schorsch’s</span> speech was a farewell
not just to the most recent class of rabbis but to the school he ran for the
last 20 years, which is the central institution of Conservative Judaism.
Amazingly, given the context—an auditorium full of major donors and a freshly
minted class of graduates and their families—<span class=SpellE>Schorsch</span>
sounded few notes of inspiration and hope for the future. Instead, he offered
his honest appraisal of Judaism’s Conservative movement, which he helped build:

to negotiate a middle ground between Orthodox Judaism… and Reform… Conservative

to accommodate modern circumstances. “Tradition and change” is a movement

explained just how bad the volume is by comparing it to the biblical story in
which Moses smashes the tablets engraved with the Ten Commandments when he sees
the Israelites fashioning a golden calf. Now, in case you don’t know much about
the Jewish view of golden calf building, aka idol worship, let me say, it’s
pretty bad. An entire fast day is devoted to mourning the tragedy of the

greeted it with silence, because there really wasn’t much more to say. His

to find a former yeshiva student who has come to JTS; that phenomenon met its
end as yeshiva education strengthened while the Conservative movement drifted
to the left. Those trained within the Conservative movement, who find the pages
of Talmud filled with the thoughts of long-dead Jewish intellectuals, will
never replicate the passion of those who find therein the living words of G-d.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Orthodox Judaism would die out in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">America</st1:country-region></st1:place>, outmoded and irrelevant.
Instead, it’s the American Jewish center that’s eroding. Conservative Judaism,
once the most popular Jewish denomination in the United States, has recently
taken second place to the more clearheaded Reform movement. About 33 percent of
American Jews affiliate with Conservative Judaism, down from 38 percent 10
years ago. And interestingly, as the Reform movement swells, to a lesser
degree, so do the numbers of Orthodox.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-font-kerning:18.0pt'>Unsurprisingly, I have a different view. The Reform
movement grew initially because the children of Conservative parents were
looking for a more casual, more innovative, and less restrictive form of
Judaism. In our day, it is growing largely due to <span class=SpellE>patrilineal</span>
descent and the welcoming of non-Jewish partners. The Orthodox <span
class=GramE>appear</span> to be growing slowly only because the non-observant,
elderly attendees of Orthodox congregations are only now being outnumbered by
the exponential growth within the ranks of the observant. That is what will
radically change Jewish demographics in the years ahead—already, the 2001 NJPS
survey revealed that the plurality of young Jews are Orthodox, and that gap is
only going to widen if trends continue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of fact and the words of Conservative leaders, the essay demonstrated how the
process of determining Conservative “<span class=SpellE>halacha</span>”
differed qualitatively and radically from the <span class=SpellE>halachic</span>
process of the millennia. <span class=SpellE>Halacha</span>, I wrote, has
always been decided (as it still is by Orthodoxy) through the objective
examination of verses, mediated through the Talmud, with determination only to
discern the Torah’s intention. By contrast, the Conservative process has often
involved first deciding a desired result, and then manipulating the sources to
yield that outcome.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Those Conservative Jews, however, who truly respect the concept of <span
class=SpellE>halacha</span> and had always accepted as fact that their movement
was committed to the traditional <span class=SpellE>halachic</span> process,
the article contended, needed to realize that such was not the case, and that

response, too, mostly from erstwhile Conservative Jews who had left the
movement for Orthodoxy and from members of Conservative synagogues who had
already come to suspect that things were as I had described them. But a small
army of Conservative leaders angrily blasted what one called my “nasty
diatribe” and accused me of hating Conservative Jews—even though my article had

thousands of years of <span class=SpellE>halachic</span> literature (not to
mention explicit verses in the Torah itself, in the case of males) declares
them sinful. Hence my “prophecy”: The Conservative movement would come in time
to “<span class=SpellE>halachically</span>” sanction what the Torah forbids in
no uncertain terms. My prediction, of course, required no supernatural powers,

contradictory “second opinion” that Conservative congregations (or, presumably,

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>An article in Slate today asks why Conservative
Judaism is having problems. I agree that both the Conservative movement (in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>) and its sibling <span class=SpellE>Masorti</span>
movement (in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>)
have to address some issues in the near future if they are to survive. But the
Slate article, for all of its good intentions, misses the mark when it comes to
the problem and viability of Conservative Judaism, particularly in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<br>
The author of the article basically claims that Conservative Judaism’s problems
are similar to other moderate religious movements.&nbsp; “Tradition and change”
is an increasingly irrelevant motto for the movement, since many American Jews
are opting for one or the other. Reform Judaism says that <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>halacha</span></span> is no longer relevant. Orthodox Judaism says
that <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>halacha</span></span> is everything,
and that if there’s a conflict between <span class=SpellE>halacha</span> and
the modern world, <span class=SpellE>halacha</span> wins out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This may all be true, but I don’t think that it
gets to the heart of the movement’s problem.<br>
(For the record: My father is a Conservative rabbi. I attended a day school
from K-12, and a Schechter high school. I attended Ramah camps for 15 years. I
was a very active member of USY, including three years on the international
board, and the creation of the <span class=SpellE>Chalutzim</span> group. [You
can blame my bad Hebrew grammar for the fact that it was long called “<span
class=SpellE>HeChalutzim</span>,” rather than “<span class=SpellE>HaChalutzim</span>.”]
In <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
I sat on the board of the <span class=SpellE>Masorti</span> movement for about
four years.&nbsp; So my criticism comes as someone from within the system.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The heart of the problem is this:
Conservative Judaism has been a spectacular failure at raising a second generation
of committed laypeople. The movement has produced brilliant thinkers and
scholarship, unparalleled educational programs, and a large number of
synagogues. But membership is declining, and that’s because children who grow
up in Conservative synagogues rarely care much about Jewish observance — and
when they do, they become rabbis, join Orthodox synagogues, or move to Israel.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I am convinced that the
Conservative movement’s decision to allow driving on Shabbat was one of the
most short-sighted mistakes that it ever made</span></b><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>. I understand the logic of the decision, which
basically claimed that Jews are moving out to the suburbs, and that if we don’t
allow them to drive to the synagogue on Shabbat, they’ll drop out of Jewish
life entirely. Perhaps that was true, and perhaps it wasn’t. But the effect of
this decision was dramatic: No longer was driving to synagogue on Shabbat
something that was tolerated by the movement for those who were unable to
afford nearby housing. Instead, it became the norm and the default, allowing
Jews to move wherever they wanted, knowing that they would always be able to
drive to the synagogue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I’m not saying that Jews shouldn’t drive on
Shabbat. I have chosen not to, but I have many friends who do, and I respect
their decision. But when most members of a synagogue live within walking
distance of one another, it creates an amazing dynamic that feeds on itself — a
positive feedback loop that strengthens the community. They can invite each
other over for Shabbat and holiday meals. Spending time with one another in
this way is a key ingredient in fostering community. When you visit someone for
a Shabbat meal, you strengthen the ties at many different levels: The kids play
together, the adults get a chance to talk, and newcomers to the community have
an opportunity to meet their new neighbors. At each of the two <span
class=SpellE>minyanim</span> we have attended in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Chicago</st1:City></st1:place> area, we were greeted not only by
friendly people who welcomed us to their community, but with numerous meal
invitations, at which we managed to form some strong, continuing friendships.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Even if everyone in a Conservative synagogue lived
within walking distance, there would still be an issue of participation.
There’s no incentive for members of most Conservative synagogues to actively
participate, because they have a rabbi and cantor to handle most of the service
for them. This contrasts with most Orthodox synagogues, where even if the same
rabbi gives a sermon each week, the congregants themselves rotate through the
remaining responsibilities, such as leading services and reading Torah. You
don’t have to do these things, and I’m sure that many people don’t. But the
stated assumption is that everyone should be able to do these things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It shouldn’t come as any surprise to discover what
happened as these trends played themselves out. The most knowledgeable, active,
and observant young people in Conservative synagogues grew up. They could
choose between a Conservative synagogue, where they would hear the same rabbi
and cantor every week, and where they were among the very small number of
people living within walking distance, and where most members lacked synagogue
skills and were uninterested in <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>halacha</span></span>.
Or they could join an Orthodox synagogue, where the members were also
knowledgeable, where they were given an opportunity to exercise (and show off)
their skills on a <span class=SpellE>regualr</span> basis, and where people
regularly socialized over meals after services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The bottom line is that Conservative synagogues
encouraged their members to take on a lifestyle which was largely unavailable
in the Conservative movement itself. Over the years, many people have told me
that the Conservative movement is a great place to learn about Jewish
observance, but that it isn’t serious enough once people learn something.
Outside of Ramah camps and a handful of synagogues, they were largely right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There are some pockets of resistance to this trend,
but I fear that it might be too little, too late. Moreover, some of the most
positive trends might be good for Conservative Judaism as an ideology, but not
as a movement. The <a href="http://www.uscj.org.il/yeshiva2005/index.php">Conservative
Yeshiva in Jerusalem</a> has been offering serious studies for a number of
years now, and has received rave reviews from everyone I know who has studied
or taught there. <a href="http://www.kehilathadar.org/"><span class=SpellE>Kehilat</span>
<span class=SpellE>Hadar</span></a> in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">New
  York</st1:State></st1:place> seems to be a larger, grown-up version of the
egalitarian <span class=SpellE>minyan</span> I attended for many years at
Harvard Hillel (which isn’t surprising, given that most or all of the founders
were active participants at that <span class=SpellE>minyan</span> while I was
there).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And as we have discovered, there are a few small
Ramah-style, or “Library” <span class=SpellE>minyanim</span> in the United
States, which have no rabbi or cantor, but a committed core of lay volunteers
who handle all of the tasks. We belong to one such <span class=SpellE>minyan</span>
in Skokie, belonged to another when we were in <st1:City w:st="on">Chicago</st1:City>,
and attended Shabbat services in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Newton</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Massachusetts</st1:State></st1:place> earlier this year.
There’s simply no comparison between these small <span class=SpellE>minyanim</span>
and even the smallest formal Conservative synagogue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To survive, I believe that the Conservative
movement will need to go through a radical overhaul. It’s no surprise that
synagogue dues are so high, when a typical synagogue has one or two rabbis, a
cantor, an education director, a youth director, several secretaries, a Hebrew
school, and (of course) an expensive building to maintain. The only way that
such large, expensive synagogues can afford to exist is by encouraging people
to <span class=GramE>join who live far away —</span> which, as I wrote above,
only helps to unravel the social fabric of the synagogue. Bringing in members
who drive solves a synagogue’s short-term financial problems at the expense of
long-term involvement and observance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If the Conservative movement is to survive, it will
be through the creation of many small- and medium-sized <span class=SpellE>minyanim</span>,
located in modest buildings within walking distance of most members. Some of
these synagogues will have rabbis, but many will not. Few will have cantors and
education directors, which will encourage the members to try their hand at
leading different parts of the service. The smaller buildings and professional
staff will make it possible to dramatically lower synagogue dues, making it
easier for more families to send their children to day schools or Ramah camps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Have you heard this prescription before? Perhaps —
it has been working very well in the Orthodox community for many years, and is
not too different from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chavurah"><span
class=SpellE>chavurah</span> movement</a> that sprung up in the late 1960s and
early 1970s. And there’s no guaranteed success. But the current trend is
clearly quite negative, and might well result in the movement’s demise within a
generation or two if the leadership isn’t careful. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Earlier
this summer, <span class=SpellE>Ismar</span> <span class=SpellE>Schorsch</span>,
the outgoing chancellor of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">New York</st1:State></st1:place>'s
Jewish Theological Seminary, kicked off his retirement with a graduation speech
that was the religious scholar's equivalent of <span class=SpellE>Zinedine</span>
<span class=SpellE>Zidane's</span> World Cup head-butt. <span class=SpellE>Schorsch's</span>
speech was a farewell not just to the most recent class of rabbis but to the
school he ran for the last 20 years, which is the central institution of
Conservative Judaism. Amazingly, given the context—an auditorium full of major
donors and a freshly minted class of graduates and their families—<span
class=SpellE>Schorsch</span> sounded few notes of inspiration and hope for the
future. Instead, he offered his honest appraisal of Judaism's Conservative
movement, which he helped build: Basically, it stinks! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Since
1886, the Jewish Theological Seminary has sought to negotiate a middle ground
between Orthodox Judaism, which (to vastly oversimplify) teaches that the Torah
and Rabbinic law were authored by God, and Reform Judaism, which sees obedience
of Jewish law, or <span class=SpellE>Halakha</span>, as a choice, not a divine
mandate. Conservative Judaism, which began as a congregational movement in
1913, attempts to bridge the gap—to affirm the divinity of ancient Jewish law
but also to allow changes to accommodate modern circumstances. &quot;Tradition
and change&quot; is a movement motto. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In his
graduation speech, <span class=SpellE>Schorsch</span> called this motto
&quot;inane&quot; and used the words &quot;impoverishment&quot; and
&quot;malaise&quot; to characterize the movement. <span class=GramE>Conservative
rabbinical students?</span> They &quot;crave instant gratification.&quot; <span
class=SpellE>Etz</span> <span class=SpellE>Hayim</span>, the edition of the
Bible recently published by the Conservative movement and used by its
synagogues around the country? &quot;Their Rabbinic authors go through the
paces without passion.&quot; <span class=SpellE>Schorsch</span> explained just
how bad the volume is by comparing it to the biblical story in which Moses
smashes the tablets engraved with the Ten Commandments when he sees the
Israelites fashioning a golden calf. Now, in case you don't know much about the
Jewish view of golden calf building, aka idol worship, let me say, it's pretty
bad. An entire fast day is devoted to mourning the tragedy of the smashing of
those tablets. Did I mention <span class=SpellE>Schorsch</span> wrote the
foreword to <span class=SpellE>Etz</span> <span class=SpellE>Hayim</span>?<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm sorry
that <span class=SpellE>Schorsch's</span> angry send-off made the ceremony a
letdown for the JTS graduates, some of whom are friends of mine. But though I
don't agree with many of the details of <span class=SpellE>Schorsch's</span>
critique, I must admit I felt an evil twinge of guilty pleasure when I read his
speech.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I grew up
in the Conservative movement, and my religious ideals line up with it in many
ways. Yet I agree that it often misses the mark and suffers, as <span
class=SpellE>Schorsch</span> said, from &quot;a failure of nerve.&quot; As the
world is growing increasingly religious, the faithful are not growing more
interested in reconciling modernity and tradition. They are becoming more
orthodox. It's somehow liberating (if not encouraging) to see the leader of a
religious movement whose goal is to hold the middle ground forcefully wrestle
with his sense of failure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In his
speech, <span class=SpellE>Schorsch</span> described the Conservative religious
ideal as one that maintains a fragile balance between two poles, truth and
faith. He said that during the heyday of the JTS, this tension was sustained by
reverent, but critical, scholarship that analyzed the historical context
surrounding Jewish texts, rather than viewing them only as a message delivered
by God at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mt.</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Sinai</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Many of the
heavy-hitters from <span class=SpellE>Schorsch's</span> golden era of
Conservative scholarship were not trained solely in the institutions of liberal
Judaism. Solomon Schechter, Mordecai Kaplan, and Abraham Joshua <span
class=SpellE>Heschel</span> came out of Orthodox yeshivas, or religious centers
of learning. Although they later studied Jewish texts as these writings would
be studied at a modern secular university, they first studied them
traditionally. They came to historical biblical criticism with a vigorous
training in the more reverent style of Jewish learning, where the highest form
is learning <span class=SpellE>leshma</span>, or &quot;for its own sake.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'>Schorsch</span></span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>
argued that today, that sort of learning has fallen out of favor because
students crave a &quot;quick spiritual fix.&quot; I think the problem is more
complicated. For starters, the JTS never figured out a way to generate the kind
of passion that is evident at most Orthodox yeshivas. The logical extension of
Conservative Judaism's academic scholarship is that to obey <span class=SpellE>Halakha</span>
just because &quot;God says so&quot; is intellectually dishonest. But if that's
the case, then why not throw over religious law, like Reform Jews do? The
middle-ground movement has come up with no satisfactory answer. It makes do
with guilt and a sort of schmaltzy ode to tradition a la Fiddler on the Roof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Take the
issue of the ordination of gay rabbis. It's a no-brainer for Reform Jews, who
allow it because they place precedence on personal choice above biblical
mandates, and for the Orthodox, who bar it because they believe that the Torah
strictly prohibits gay sex. But for Conservatives, it's a crisis, because the
movement lacks a clear theology to navigate between the poles of tradition and
change, even as the gap between them becomes ever wider. As a result, the
decision to admit openly gay rabbinical students to JTS has been bitterly
contested, tabled, avoided, and fought over for the last half-dozen or so
years. <span class=SpellE>Schorsch</span> has said in previous interviews that
advocates for the ordination of gay rabbis are bending and manipulating <span
class=SpellE>Halakha</span> rather than looking at it honestly. His despair
over this issue surely motivated some of the ferocity of his speech. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But
Conservative Judaism has never adequately explained how its rabbis or
congregants should decide which aspects of modern times are worth adjusting the
law to, and which aren't. The decision in 1972 to ordain women rabbis at JTS
wasn't advocated by the institutions' Talmudic scholars but by a committee of
lay people. They made many strong moral and ethical arguments for ordaining
women, but they couldn't ground their stance coherently in Jewish law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Still
earlier, in 1961, the Conservative movement issued a ruling permitting driving
on Shabbat—but only to synagogue. Orthodox Jews, by contrast, observe the
prohibition against driving and build their neighborhoods around their
synagogues and each other's homes. There is something powerful about this
decision: The foundation of the community is a countercultural value that
requires some sacrifice in the name of a higher purpose. While it might be
possible to read Jewish law to permit driving on Shabbat or ordaining a woman
rabbi, both of those choices seem motivated by a reluctant acquiescence to the
demands of the time rather than by a deep and reverent reading of the texts.
Orthodox Jews also change the law—you won't find any of them following the
Torah's injunction to forgive all loans every seven years, or to stone a
rebellious child—but they do so in a way that has internal coherence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Liberal
denominations of any faith tend to make a religion out of tolerance and humanistic
values. But this misses some of the point of faith. There is a sweetness,
intensity, and pleasure that <span class=GramE>comes</span> from religious
practice that isn't wholly rational.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Earlier
in this century, the common wisdom was that Orthodox Judaism would die out in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
outmoded and irrelevant. Instead, it's the American Jewish center that's
eroding. Conservative Judaism, once the most popular Jewish denomination in the
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
has recently taken second place to the more clearheaded Reform movement. About
33 percent of American Jews affiliate with Conservative Judaism, down from 38
percent 10 years ago. And interestingly, as the Reform movement swells, to a
lesser degree, so do the numbers of Orthodox. And as sociologist Samuel <span
class=SpellE>Heilman</span> shows in his recent book, Sliding to the Right, the
form of Orthodoxy that's on the rise is the more extremist and isolationist
sort—the congregations and movements that are deliberately at odds with

project of looking squarely at the demands of our time and Jewish texts is both
true to Jewish tradition and badly needed at this particular historical moment,
and I wish it didn't seem to be faltering. People of all faiths who are trying

Although I don't think he said it in the right way or at the right time, I hope

Conservative Rabbis Predict Gay Ban Will Fall, Canadian <span class=SpellE>Shuls</span>
Weigh <br>
Split With Movement <br>
<br>
<br>
Jennifer Siegel and Rebecca Spence | Wed. August 30, 2006<br>
With leaders of Conservative Judaism predicting an end to the <br>
outright ban on gay ordination and same-sex marriage, some of the <br>
movement's more traditional Canadian synagogues are threatening to <br>
form a breakaway coalition.<br>
<br>
Several movement leaders, speaking at an August 24 meeting in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State
 w:st="on">New <br>
  York</st1:State></st1:place>, said that the ordination of gay rabbis and the
sanctioning of <br>
same-sex marriage within Conservative Judaism are near certain. <br>
Organized by the movement's congregational arm, the United Synagogue <br>
of Conservative Judaism, the gathering offered a preview of the <br>
<span class=SpellE>halachic</span> opinions on homosexuality that are likely to
be approved at <br>
a December meeting of the movement's Committee on Jewish Law and <br>
Standards. A similar meeting was held the previous day in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Toronto</st1:City></st1:place>, <br>
with congregations there.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the gatherings, said the <span class=SpellE>USCJ's</span>
executive vice <br>
president, Rabbi Jerome Epstein, was to help congregations begin to <br>
prepare for the &quot;day after&quot; the rulings are handed down.<br>
<br>
In December, the law committee &quot;might accept — will accept, I think —<br>
two or more of the papers [currently under consideration]: one that <br>
affirms the current state of affairs, and one, at least, that <br>
liberalizes it,&quot; Epstein told the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">New
  York</st1:State></st1:place> audience. The movement <br>
has room enough for congregations differing in their treatment of <br>
homosexuality, he said, adding that even if the movement adopts a <br>
more liberal position, individual communities will have the final <br>
say as to what course to pursue.<br>
<br>
Despite such promises of autonomy on the issue, in Canada, where <br>
Conservative synagogues tend to be more traditional than their <br>
American counterparts, the talk of a more liberal policy is <br>
emboldening those who advocate for abandoning the movement's North <br>
American congregational arm altogether.<br>
<br>
&quot;The issue of gay ordination will certainly exacerbate the situation <br>
for us here in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region> and
may indeed be the straw that pushes us <br>
into this declaration of independence,&quot; said Rabbi Steven <span
class=SpellE>Saltzman</span>, <br>
who presides over <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Toronto</st1:City></st1:place>'s
<span class=SpellE>Adath</span> Israel Congregation. &quot;The movement <br>
in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region></st1:place>
has moved so far to the left on issues of tradition that <br>
we find it difficult to fall in step behind it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The possibility of a Canadian split from the USCJ first surfaced <br>
last year over the equally contentious matter of egalitarian <br>
services. At the <span class=SpellE>USCJ's</span> 2005 biennial convention in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Boston</st1:City></st1:place>, an <br>
American rabbi prompted an outcry from his peers to the north when <br>
he suggested that allowing <span class=SpellE>nonegalitarian</span>
congregations — those that <br>
restrict women's participation — in the movement was immoral and <br>
misogynistic. Only a handful of the 19 Conservative synagogues in <br>
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region></st1:place>
are egalitarian.<br>
<br>
The controversy ignited discussions among rabbis and lay leaders in <br>
Toronto and Montreal to consider whether they might forge a separate <br>
Canadian synagogue group while maintaining ties to the Conservative <br>
movement in America.<br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE>Saltzman</span>, who has led the charge to break away from
the USCJ, <br>
contends that the creation of a distinctly Canadian group would not <br>
be an all-out rejection of the Conservative movement. He cites as <br>
examples <st1:country-region w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region> and <st1:place
w:st="on">South America</st1:place>, where there are independent <br>
groups that still play a role with the Conservative movement <br>
internationally.<br>
<br>
Some Conservative leaders in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region></st1:place>
downplayed the possibility of a <br>
split.<br>
<br>
According to Paul <span class=SpellE>Kochberg</span>, president of the <span
class=SpellE>USCJ's</span> Canadian region, <br>
previous discussions surrounding the possibility of creating a <br>
distinct Canadian union already have faltered. <span class=SpellE>Kochberg</span>,
who is also <br>
chairman of the <span class=SpellE>USCJ's</span> council of regional presidents,
said that he <br>
would oppose any plan to disengage from the central North American <br>
body, and that he saw it as an unlikely possibility for the future.<br>
<br>
&quot;The real concern about the liberal direction of the Conservative <br>
movement is centered <span class=GramE>around</span> a few synagogues in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Toronto</st1:City></st1:place>,&quot; said <br>
<span class=SpellE>Kochberg</span>, referring in part to <span class=SpellE>Saltzman's</span>
congregation. &quot;And because <br>
I don't believe the sentiment is widespread beyond those couple <br>
synagogues in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Toronto</st1:City></st1:place>,
I don't think there's a great deal of support <br>
for the notion&quot; of a breakaway organization.<br>
<br>
At the recent USCJ meeting in New York, Epstein acknowledged that <br>
while he believed that the movement had room enough for <br>
congregations differing in their treatment of homosexuality, the <br>
question of whether or not to accept gay rabbis and gay <br>
marriage &quot;could be, at least theoretically, divisive&quot; within <br>
synagogues.<br>
<br>
In an interview with the Forward, Epstein expressed concern over the <br>
possibility of losing the Canadian region. &quot;I'd be foolish to tell <br>
you that this doesn't affect us,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;we want to <br>
keep those congregations in.&quot;<br>
<br>
Epstein said it is important that &quot;rightwing congregations feel <br>
comfortable&quot; in the movement. &quot;We have a lot of things we identify <br>
with together, we share a lot of common goals, and it's important <br>
for us try as much as possible to work with them.&quot; And that, he <br>
added, includes engaging in dialogue and displaying sensitivity to <br>
different views, as was done at the meetings in <st1:City w:st="on">Toronto</st1:City>
and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">New York</st1:State></st1:place>.<br>
<br>
For several years, the Rabbinical Assembly's law committee has been <br>
actively reconsidering the movement's historical ban on <br>
homosexuality, which was affirmed as recently as 1992 and stems from <br>
a passage in Leviticus stating, &quot;Do not lie with a man as one lies <br>
with a woman; it is an abomination.&quot; This past March, four opinions —<br>
two on either side of the issue — were submitted to the committee <br>
for review, with the final vote scheduled for December.<br>
<br>
Since that time, Conservative Judaism has ushered in another <br>
dramatic change: In April, the movement's flagship institution, the <br>
Jewish Theological Seminary of America, announced that its retiring <br>
longtime chancellor, Rabbi <span class=SpellE>Ismar</span> <span class=SpellE>Schorsch</span>,
would be succeeded by <br>
Arnold <span class=SpellE>Eisen</span>, a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Stanford</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
professor who is not a rabbi. <br>
While <span class=SpellE>Schorsch</span> had been an unflagging opponent of
lifting the ban on <br>
homosexuality and had long argued that such a move could split the <br>
movement, <span class=SpellE>Eisen</span> quickly voiced his support for
allowing gays and <br>
lesbians into the rabbinate. Rabbi Bradley <span class=SpellE>Arston</span>,
dean of the <br>
Conservative movement's rabbinical school at the <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>
of <br>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Judaism</st1:PlaceName> in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Los Angeles</st1:City></st1:place>, has said in the past that he
would admit gay <br>
rabbinical students if the ban is lifted. The rector of <span class=SpellE>U.J.'s</span>
<br>
rabbinical seminary, Rabbi Elliot <span class=SpellE>Dorff</span>, is a law
committee member <br>
and a co-author of the liberal opinion that is expected to pass.<br>
<br>
On August 24, at Congregation <span class=SpellE>Shaare</span> <span
class=SpellE>Zedek</span> on <st1:City w:st="on">Manhattan</st1:City>'s <st1:place
w:st="on">Upper West <br>
 Side</st1:place>, the panelists included <span class=SpellE>Dorff</span> and
Rabbi Joel Roth, a fellow law <br>
committee member and a professor at JTS. <span class=SpellE>Dorff's</span>
opinion — co-<br>
authored with rabbis Daniel Nevins and <span class=SpellE>Avram</span> <span
class=SpellE>Reisner</span> — would permit <br>
gay ordination and marriage, as well as some homosexual acts, while <br>
maintaining a ban on anal sex. Roth's opinion, which is largely a <br>
restatement of his approved 1992 opinion, would uphold the ban on <br>
homosexuality. Throughout the evening, the speakers repeatedly <br>
expressed certainty that both would pass.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think it's a foregone conclusion&quot; that there will be two <br>
decisions passed, Roth told the Forward after the event. &quot;The only <br>
question is whether there will be two or three passed,&quot; he added in <br>
reference to another liberal decision, co-authored by Rabbi Gordon <br>
Tucker of <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Temple</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Israel</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType> in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">White Plains</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">N.Y.</st1:State></st1:place>,
that would <br>
lift all restrictions on homosexual behavior.<br>
<br>
Controversy over procedural issues has dogged the law committee <br>
since its March meeting, when a majority of members voted to <br>
designate Tucker's opinion as a <span class=SpellE>takanah</span>, or amendment
to biblical <br>
law, rather than as a <span class=SpellE>teshuvah</span>, or interpretation. The
distinction <br>
proved important because while under movement rules a <span class=SpellE>teshuvah</span>
only <br>
requires the votes of six of the 25 voting members on the law <br>
committee to be considered an acceptable <span class=GramE>interpretation,</span>
in June <br>
2005 the <span class=SpellE>R.A.'s</span> executive committee adopted a rule
stipulating that <br>
a decision designated as a <span class=SpellE>takanah</span> would require 20
votes to pass. <br>
Previously there had not been different thresholds for the two kinds <br>
of decisions, and the author of an opinion had discretion over that <br>
opinion's designation.<br>
<br>
Although members of the R.A. voted to lower the threshold for <br>
passing <span class=SpellE>takanot</span> to 13 votes at their convention in
late March, the <br>
prospects for Tucker's opinion remain murky. In an e-mail to the <br>
Forward, Tucker said that he was removing his name from the opinion <br>
that he co-authored, which is being considered with several other <br>
liberal papers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Since the Committee has, in effect, acquiesced in the Rabbinical <br>
Assembly Executive Council decision to allow a majority of the <br>
Committee to declare a <span class=SpellE>Teshuvah</span> to be a <span
class=SpellE>Takanah</span>, over the objection <br>
of the author of the <span class=SpellE>Teshuvah</span>, I am unwilling to
grant legitimacy to <br>
this process, even implicitly,&quot; Tucker wrote. &quot;What has
happened,&quot; <br>
he continued, &quot;is a serious reversal of 79 years of Law Committee <br>
practice, which will have all sorts of negative, and unintended (I <br>
assume) consequences. In effect, no position held by a minority of <br>
the Law Committee on any sufficiently contentious issue can any <br>
longer gain legitimacy in the Movement, since a bare majority of the <br>
Committee can quash it by voting to declare it to be a <span class=SpellE>Takanah</span>.
I <br>
will not participate in the process as an author under these <br>
circumstances (though I will participate as a voting member in the <br>
deliberations).&quot;<br>
<br>
While the discussion in March had suggested that some law committee <br>
members believed that <span class=SpellE>Dorff's</span> opinion also might be
in danger of <br>
being designated as a <span class=SpellE>takanah</span>, <span class=SpellE>Dorff</span>
told the Forward that he viewed <br>
that possibility as highly unlikely.<br>
<br>
In an interview with the Forward after the meeting, Epstein said <br>
that the USCJ is planning additional meetings on homosexuality in <br>
other cities this fall, and is currently exploring other ways of <br>
helping congregations deal with the likely decisions.<br>
<br>
At the meeting in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">New York</st1:State></st1:place>,
both Epstein and <span class=SpellE>Dorff</span> affirmed a <br>
commonly held view among Conservative leaders that the movement is <br>
a &quot;big tent&quot; that proudly tolerates a multiplicity of opinions on <br>
such difficult questions as the role of women and the permissibility <br>
of gay relationships. Roth, however, said he viewed the movement as <br>
being more like a &quot;bell curve&quot; than like an &quot;umbrella,&quot; and
worried <br>
that as the curve moves to the left on social issues, those who do <br>
not favor liberalization feel increasingly rejected.<br>
<br>
&quot;At this time, the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Judaism</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> has no <span
class=SpellE>nonegalitarian</span> <br>
<span class=SpellE>minyan</span> and JTS does with some difficulty,&quot; Roth
told the audience, <br>
adding that, in his view, JTS students who do not believe that women <br>
should count in a <span class=SpellE>minyan</span> or be called to the Torah
&quot;are reviled and <br>
castigated by their peers as moral misogynists.&quot;<br>
