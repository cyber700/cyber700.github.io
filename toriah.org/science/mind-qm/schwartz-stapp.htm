<b>Abstract</b>: Neuropsychological research on the neural basis of behaviour 
generally posits that brain mechanisms will ultimately suffice to explain all 
psychologically described phenomena. This assumption stems from the idea that 
the brain is made up entirely of material particles and fields, and that all 
causal mechanisms relevant to neuroscience can therefore be formulated solely in 
terms of properties of these elements. Thus, terms having intrinsic mentalistic 
and/or experiential content (e.g. ‘feeling’, ‘knowing’ and ‘effort’) are not 
included as primary causal factors. This theoretical restriction is motivated 
primarily by ideas about the natural world that have been known to be 
fundamentally incorrect for more than three-quarters of a century. Contemporary 
basic physical theory differs profoundly from classic physics on the important 
matter of how the consciousness of human agents enters into the structure of 
empirical phenomena. The new principles contradict the older idea that local 
mechanical processes alone can account for the structure of all observed 
empirical data. Contemporary physical theory brings directly and irreducibly 
into the overall causal structure certain psychologically described choices made 
by human agents about how they will act. This key development in basic physical 
theory is applicable to neuroscience, and it provides neuroscientists and 
psychologists with an alternative conceptual framework for describing neural 
processes. Indeed, owing to certain structural features of ion channels critical 
to synaptic function, contemporary physical theory must in principle be used 
when analysing human brain dynamics. The new framework, unlike its 
classic-physics-based predecessor, is erected directly upon, and is compatible 
with, the prevailing principles of physics. It is able to represent more 
adequately than classic concepts the neuroplastic mechanisms relevant to the 
growing number of empirical studies of the capacity of directed attention and 
mental effort to systematically alter brain function. <br>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From the <b>conclusion</b>:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Materialist ontology draws no support from 
contemporary physics and is in fact contradicted by it. The notion that all 
physical behaviour is explainable in principle solely in terms of a local 
mechanical process is a holdover from physical theories of an earlier era. It 
was rejected by the founders of quantum mechanics, who introduced, crucially 
into the basic dynamical equations, choices that are not determined by local 
mechanical processes, but are rather attributed to human agents. These orthodox 
quantum equations, applied to human brains in the way suggested by John von 
Neumann, provide for a causal account of recent neuropsychological data. In this 
account brain behaviour that appears to be caused by mental effort is actually 
caused by mental effort: the causal efficacy of mental effort is no illusion. 
Our wilful choices enter neither as redundant nor epiphenomenal effects, but 
rather as fundamental dynamical elements that have the causal efficacy that the 
objective data appear to assign to them.<br>
