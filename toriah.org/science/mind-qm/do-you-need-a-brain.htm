<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Is Your Brain Really Necessary?</b><br>
Roger Lewin<br>
Science, New Series, Vol. 210, No. 4475. (Dec. 12, 1980), pp. 1232-1234.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's a young student at this university,&quot; 
says Lorber, &quot;who has an IQ of 126, has gained a first-class honors degree in 
mathematics, and is socially completely normal. And yet the boy has virtually no 
brain.&quot; The student's physician at the university noticed that the youth had a 
slightly larger than normal head, and so referred him to Lorber, simply out of 
interest. &quot;When we did a brain scan on him,&quot; Lorber recalls, &quot;we saw that 
instead of the normal 4.5-centimeter thickness of brain tissue between the 
ventricles and the cortical surface, there was just a thin layer of mantle 
measuring a millimeter or so. His cranium is filled mainly with cerebrospinal 
fluid.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is dramatic by any standards, and Lorber 
clearly enjoys retailing the story. But, startling as it may seem, this case is 
nothing new to the medical world. &quot;Scores of similar accounts litter the medical 
literature, and they go back a long way,&quot; observes Patrick Wall, professor of 
anatomy at University College, London, &quot;but the important thing about Lorber is 
that he's done a long series of systematic scanning, rather than just dealing 
with anecdotes. He has gathered a remarkable set of data and he challenges, `How 
do we explain it?' &quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">How can someone with a grossly reduced cerebral 
mantle not only move among his fellows with no apparent social deficit, but also 
reach high academic achievement? How is it that in some hydrocephalics whose 
brains are severely distorted asymmetrically, the expected one-sided paralysis 
is typically absent? And how is one to interpret the apparent restoration to 
normality of a hydrocephalic brain following a shunt operation? These are the 
challenges that Lorber is proffering his neurology colleagues.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As to the question &quot;Is your brain really 
necessary?&quot; Lorber admits that it is only half serious. &quot;You have to be dramatic 
in order to make people listen,&quot; concedes the tactician. Bower's answer to the 
tongue-in-cheek question is this: &quot;Although Lorber's work doesn't demonstrate 
that we don't need a brain, it does show that the brain can work in conditions 
we would have thought impossible.&quot; Bower occasionally complains that Lorber's 
style is less scientific than it might be. He concedes, however, that &quot;there are 
still many questions to be answered about the human brain, and it has to be 
admitted that Lorber's provocative approach does make you think about them.&quot;-<br>
