			<font face="Verdana" size="2">The confusing of evidence for common 
			descent with evidence for Darwin’s unintelligent evolutionary 
			mechanism of random mutation/natural selection (RM/NS) is a frequent 
			source of befuddlement in discussions of intelligent design vs 
			Darwinism. Yet perhaps it’s not too surprising that many people are 
			bewildered -- after all, Darwin himself was frequently confused!</font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">As Ernst Mayr pointed out in
			<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0674639065/qid=1117570589/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-8766061-0117424?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">
			One Long Argument</a> (p. 36): </font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That writers on Darwin have 
				nevertheless almost invariably spoken of the combination of 
				these various theories as “Darwin’s theory” in the singular is 
				in part Darwin’s own doing. He not only referred to the theory 
				of evolution by common descent as “my theory,” but he also 
				called the theory of evolution by natural selection “my theory,” 
				as if common descent and natural selection were a single theory. 
				. . . [Darwin] ascribed many phenomena, particularly those of 
				geographic distribution, to natural selection when they were 
				really the consequences of common descent.</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Similarities between structures 
			are, at best, evidence for common descent, but do not themselves say 
			anything at all about RM/NS. In order to show that Darwin’s 
			mechanism of RM/NS is responsible for either a new structure or a 
			new function for an old structure, one has to show, as Darwin 
			insisted, that there is a pathway leading to the structure by 
			“numerous, successive, slight modifications”, each of which is an 
			improvement for the organism. That is a much, much more difficult 
			task than simply showing similarities between features. Mayr showed 
			that, while most early scientists agreed with Darwin’s idea of 
			common descent, few agreed with him on natural selection.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The much greater difficulty of 
			showing how a system might develop by “numerous, successive, slight 
			modifications” versus simply showing similarities in structures is 
			illustrated in the tale of Russell Doolittle and the
			<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&db=books&doptcmdl=GenBookHL&term=blood+clot+AND+stryer%5Bbook%5D+AND+215743%5Buid%5D&rid=stryer.figgrp.1401">
			blood clotting cascade</a>, which I have discussed more fully in 
			other places (for example,
			<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=1d74a6c4d5944ae090f0d2d621bd0c71&referrer=parent&backto=searcharticlesresults,1,1;journal,1,1;linkingpublicationresults,1:102856,1">
			here</a> and
			<a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=442">
			here</a>). Briefly,
			<a href="http://www-biology.ucsd.edu/faculty/doolittle.html">
			Professor Doolittle</a>, an expert on blood clotting, wrote an essay 
			in 1997 in
			<a href="http://www.bostonreview.net/br22.1/doolittle.html">Boston 
			Review</a> in which he asserted there was experimental evidence from 
			laboratory mice refuting my claim in
			<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684834936/qid=1117571201/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-8766061-0117424?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">
			Darwin’s Black Box</a> that the blood clotting cascade was 
			irreducibly complex. It turns out, however, that he had misread the
			<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=8929539&query_hl=11">
			paper</a> he was citing, and the lab mice’s altered clotting system 
			was broken. The most important point to note, I think, from 
			Doolittle’s error is that it showed clearly he did not know how 
			Darwinian mechanisms produced the clotting system. If he did, he 
			would simply have said so in the essay, or else would have cited a 
			paper (or, rather, a long series of papers) where the system had 
			been accounted for by “numerous, successive, slight modifications”. 
			And if an expert such as Professor Doolittle does not know, then 
			nobody knows.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another important conclusion we can 
			draw from the error is that protein sequence data are insufficient 
			to tell us how a Darwinian mechanism might have produced a complex 
			molecular system. Many of the proteins of the clotting system are 
			quite similar in sequence and structure to each other and also 
			similar to other, non clotting proteins. Professor Doolittle knew 
			all about the structural and sequence similarities. Yet that 
			knowledge did not allow him to say how RM/NS could have put together 
			the clotting system. The structural similarity may point to the 
			proteins being derived by descent from a common precursor protein, 
			but it says nothing about Darwin’s mechanism of RM/NS. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A third important lesson to draw 
			from Professor Doolittle’s mistake is that Darwinists often have 
			extremely low standards of evidence to support their theory. Any 
			remotely, superficially plausible account for the origin of system 
			is taken by the Darwinian faithful as earth-shaking evidence that 
			unintelligent mechanisms can do the trick. And anyone skeptical of 
			the just-so story is often derided as either dumb or as having 
			vaguely nefarious motives.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although Professor Doolittle made 
			his illuminating mistake a long time ago (eight years now -- time 
			flies!) the lessons continue to be relevant. Two very recent essays 
			make the same, glaring mistake of taking evidence of common descent 
			to be evidence of RM/NS. The first essay was by University of 
			Rochester evolutionary biologist
			<a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/BIO/faculty/Orr.html">
			Allen Orr</a> in
			<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050530fa_fact">
			The New Yorker</a>, who wrote:</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Biologists actually know a 
				great deal about the evolution of biochemical systems, 
				irreducibly complex or not. It's significant, for instance, that 
				the proteins that typically make up the parts of these systems 
				are often similar to one another. (Blood clotting -- another of 
				Behe's examples of irreducible complexity --&nbsp; involves at 
				least twenty proteins, several of which are similar, and all of 
				which are needed to make clots, to localize or remove clots, or 
				to prevent the runaway clotting of all blood.) And biologists 
				understand why these proteins are so similar. Each gene in an 
				organism's genome encodes a particular protein. Occasionally, 
				the stretch of DNA that makes up a particular gene will get 
				accidentally copied, yielding a genome that includes two 
				versions of the gene. Over many generations, one version of the 
				gene will often keep its original function while the other one 
				slowly changes by mutation and natural selection, picking up a 
				new, though usually related, function. This process of &quot;gene 
				duplication&quot; has given rise to entire families of proteins that 
				have similar functions; they often act in the same biochemical 
				pathway or sit in the same cellular structure. There's no doubt 
				that gene duplication plays an extremely important role in the 
				evolution of biological complexity. </font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, as I pointed out in
			<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684834936/qid=1117571802/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-8766061-0117424?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">
			Darwin’s Black Box</a> years ago (pp. 89-90), while gene duplication 
			does indeed occur, and similar proteins may be descended from an 
			ancestral one, none of that says anything at all about how a complex 
			system could be put together by “numerous, successive, slight 
			modifications” by RM/NS. That is an entirely separate question which 
			needs much additional evidence to support it. Russell Doolittle knew 
			all about gene duplication, yet couldn’t explain how Darwinian 
			processes produced the clotting cascade. And if Russell Doolittle 
			doesn’t know how the clotting cascade could have been put together 
			in a Darwinian fashion, then Allen Orr certainly doesn’t either, nor 
			does anyone else on earth.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The second recent essay was posted 
			at the <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001081.html">
			Panda’s Thumb</a> blog by
			<a href="http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/gebs/faculty/Andrea_Bottaro.htm">
			Andrea Bottaro</a>, a Professor of Medicine who is also at the 
			University of Rochester. Professor Bottaro pointed to a recent
			<a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030181">
			paper</a> which finds some sequence homology between

			RAG1</a> (an enzyme which is involved in recombination of antibody 
			genes to generate extensive diversity) and transposases from the <em>
			Transib</em> superfamily of transposons. (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&db=books&doptcmdl=GenBookHL&term=transposon+AND+cooper%5Bbook%5D+AND+165398%5Buid%5D&rid=cooper.section.828#838">Transposons</a> 
			are elements of DNA that code for enzymes -- transposases -- that 
			can either move the DNA element to a new location in a genome or 
			place new copies of the DNA elsewhere.) That of course is a very 
			interesting result, and may say something about the ancestry of the 
			protein, but it does not say anything at all about RM/NS. Bottaro 
			also cites earlier interesting work showing some mechanistic 
			similarities between RAG1and some transposases. However, there are 
			far greater mechanistic similarities between components of the blood 
			clotting cascade and, as Doolittle’s mistake makes clear, such 
			similarities simply don’t tell how RM/NS could have built such a 
			system.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Professor Bottaro, perhaps sensing 
			that the paper he cites won’t be persuasive to people who are 
			skeptical of Darwinian claims, laments that “Behe and other ID 
			advocates will retreat further and further into impossible demands, 
			such as asking for mutation-by-mutation accounts of specific 
			evolutionary pathways...” Well, yes, of course that’s exactly what I 
			ask of Darwinian claims -- a mutation-by-mutation account of 
			critical steps (which will likely be very, very many), at the amino 
			acid level. But that’s neither a “retreat” (In
			<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684834936/qid=1117573237/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-8766061-0117424?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">
			Darwin's Black Box</a> (page 176)I implied that many small details 
			would be necessary for a real Darwinian explanation) nor is it 
			unreasonable -- that’s simply what’s necessary to actually explain 
			the appearance of a complex, functional system in a Darwinian 
			fashion, to show that it could indeed happen as Darwinists claim. <b>
			Proteins change single mutation by single mutation, amino acid by 
			amino acid, so that’s the level of explanation that is needed</b>. 
			What part of “numerous, successive, slight” is so hard to 
			understand?</font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">And not only a list of 
			mutations, but also a detailed account of the selective pressures 
			that would be operating, the difficulties such changes would cause 
			for the organism, the expected time scale over which the changes 
			would be expected to occur, the likely population sizes available in 
			the relevant ancestral species at each step, other potential ways to 
			solve the problem which might interfere, and much more. 
			Alternatively, Darwinists could present a series of experiments 
			showing that RM/NS is capable of building a system of the complexity 
			of the adaptive immune system.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Professors Orr and Bottaro seem to 
			think that because Darwinists’ fantastic claims are very difficult 
			to support in a convincing fashion, then they should just be given a 
			pass, and that everyone should agree with them without the required 
			evidence. As Russell Doolittle helpfully showed, Darwinists find it 
			easy to imagine that evolution could proceed along pathways which 
			nature would never allow. Like
			<a href="http://www.ucomics.com/calvinandhobbes/">Calvin and Hobbes</a>, 
			in their imaginations they hop into a box and fly over treacherous 
			evolutionary terrain that nature would have to try to cross on foot. 
			There is no reason for skeptics to trust Darwinists’ imaginations.</font><hr>
