Dear Dr. Abrams:<br>
<br>
I have been following the controversy over the adoption of new science standards 
in your state with interest. I am writing—as a member of the National Academy of 
Sciences—to voice my strong support for the idea that students should be able to 
study scientific criticisms of the evidence for modern evolutionary theory along 
with the evidence favoring the theory.<br>
<br>
All too often, the issue of how to teach evolutionary theory has been dominated 
by voices at the extremes. On one extreme, many religious activists have 
advocated for Bible-based ideas about creation to be taught and for evolution to 
be eliminated from the science curriculum entirely. On the other hand, many 
committed Darwinian biologists present students with an idealized version of the 
theory that glosses over real problems and prevents students from learning about 
genuine scientific criticisms of it.<br>
<br>
Both these extremes are mistaken. <b>Evolution is an important theory and 
students need to know about it. But scientific journals now document many 
scientific problems and criticisms of evolutionary theory and students need to 
know about these as well.</b><br>
<br>
<b>Many of the scientific criticisms of which I speak are well known by 
scientists in various disciplines, including the disciplines of chemistry and 
biochemistry, in which I have done my work. I have found that some of my 
scientific colleagues are very reluctant to acknowledge the existence of 
problems with evolutionary theory to the general public. They display an almost 
religious zeal for a strictly Darwinian view of biological origins.</b><br>
<br>
Darwinian evolution is an interesting theory about the remote history of life. 
Nonetheless, <b>it has little practical impact on those branches of science that 
do not address questions of biological history</b> (largely based on stones, the 
fossil evidence). Modern biology is engaged in the examination of tissues from 
living organisms with new methods and instruments. None of the great discoveries 
in biology and medicine over the past century depended on guidance from 
Darwinian evolution---it provided no support. <br>
<br>
As an aside, one might ask what Darwin would have written today if he was aware 
of the present state of knowledge of cell biology, rather than that of the mid 
19th century when it was generally believed the cell was an enclosed blob of 
gelatin? As an exemplar, I draw your attention to what Prof. James A. Shapiro, 
bacteriologist, U. of Chicago, wrote (<a href="http://www.bostonreview.net/br22.1/shapiro.html">http://www.bostonreview.net/br22.1/shapiro.html</a>).<br>
<br>
<b>For those scientists who take it seriously, Darwinian evolution has 
functioned more as a philosophical belief system than as a testable scientific 
hypothesis. This quasi-religious function of the theory is, I think, what lies 
behind many of the extreme statements that you have doubtless encountered from 
some scientists opposing any criticism of neo-Darwinism in the classroom. It is 
also why many scientists make public statements about the theory that they would 
not defend privately to other scientists like me.</b><br>
<br>
In my judgment, this state of affairs has persisted mainly because too many 
scientists were afraid to challenge what had become a philosophical orthodoxy 
among their colleagues. Fortunately, that is changing as many scientists are now 
beginning to examine the evidence for neo-Darwinism more openly and critically 
in scientific journals.<br>
<br>
Intellectual freedom is fundamental to the scientific method. Learning to think 
creatively, logically and critically is the most important training that young 
scientists can receive. Encouraging students to carefully examine the evidence 
for and against neo-Darwinism, therefore, will help prepare students not only to 
understand current scientific arguments, but also to do good scientific 
research.<br>
<br>
I commend you for your efforts to ensure that students are more fully informed 
about current debates over neo-Darwinism in the scientific community.<br>
<br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
<br>
