<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">American Spectator Weighs in on Intelligent 
Design in the June 2005 issue. Dan Peterson's absorbing article begins:</font></p>
<div class="bText">
	<blockquote>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;IMAGINE A NANOTECHNOLOGY MACHINE far 
		beyond the state of the art: a microminiaturized rotary motor and 
		propeller system that drives a tiny vessel through liquid. The engine 
		and drive mechanism are composed of 40 parts, including a rotor, stator, 
		driveshaft, bushings, universal joint, and flexible propeller. The 
		engine is powered by a flow of ions, can rotate at up to 100,000 rpm 
		(ten times faster than a NASCAR racing engine), and can reverse 
		direction in a quarter of a rotation. The system comes with an automatic 
		feedback control mechanism. The engine itself is about 1/100,000th of an 
		inch wide, far smaller than can be seen by the human eye.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Most of us would be pleasantly 
		surprised to learn that some genius had designed such an engineering 
		triumph. What might come as a greater surprise is that there is a 
		dominant faction in the scientific community that is prepared to defend, 
		at all costs, the assertion that this marvelous device could not 
		possibly have been designed, must have been produced blindly by 
		unintelligent material forces, and only gives the appearance of being 
		designed.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;As you may have guessed, these 
		astonishingly complex, tiny, and efficient engines exist. Millions of 
		them exist inside you, in fact. They are true rotary motors that drive 
		the bacterial flagellum, a whip-like propulsion device for certain 
		bacteria, including the famous E. coli that lives in your digestive 
		system.&quot;</font></p>
