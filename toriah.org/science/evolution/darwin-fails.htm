<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Evolutionists keep insisting that evolution is 
a fact beyond any rational debate. However, Kuhn has told us that scientists 
often keep hacking away under inadequate paradigms despite the build-up of 
difficulties. In fact, they do not admit to any difficulties until they find a 
new paradigm. The authors of a new Yale University Press monograph claim that 
their new hypothesis of facilitated evolution can explain the appearance of 
design in nature (grains of salt come in handy when claims like this are made). 
However, this example bears Kuhn out, as the authors admit:<i><b> </b>In the 150 
years since Darwin, the field of evolutionary biology has left a <b>glaring gap</b> 
in understanding how animals developed their astounding variety and complexity. 
The standard answer has been that small genetic mutations accumulate over time 
to produce wondrous innovations such as eyes and wings. Drawing on cutting-edge 
research across the spectrum of modern biology, Marc Kirschner and John Gerhart 
demonstrate how this stock answer is woefully inadequate.</i></font></p>

Plausibility of Life</a><br>
Resolving Darwin’s Dilemma<br>
Marc W. Kirschner and John C. Gerhart; Illustrated by John Norton <br>
Yale University Press <br>
<br>
Two eminent biologists tackle and provide exhilarating new answers to what they 
argue is the central, unresolved question of evolution <br>
In the 150 years since Darwin, the field of evolutionary biology has left a 
glaring gap in understanding how animals developed their astounding variety and 
complexity. The standard answer has been that small genetic mutations accumulate 
over time to produce wondrous innovations such as eyes and wings.<b> Drawing on 
cutting-edge research across the spectrum of modern biology, Marc Kirschner and 
John Gerhart demonstrate how this stock answer is woefully inadequate.</b> 
Rather they offer an original solution to the longstanding puzzle of how small 
random genetic change can be converted into complex, useful innovations.<br>
<br>
In a new theory they call “facilitated variation,” Kirschner and Gerhart elevate 
the individual organism from a passive target of natural selection to a central 
player in the 3-billion-year history of evolution. In clear, accessible 
language, the authors invite every reader to contemplate daring new ideas about 
evolution. By closing the major gap in Darwin’s theory Kirschner and Gerhart 
also provide a timely scientific rebuttal to modern critics of evolution who 
champion “intelligent design.”<br>

Reviews<br>
“Kirschner and Gerhart address some of the most interesting questions in current 
biology with enthusiasm and intellectual boldness. A remarkable advance in 
understanding evolution.”—Alan H. Brush, Emeritus, University of Connecticut&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
&quot;In this terrific new book, molecular systems meet evolution. The result is a 
wealth of stimulating ideas set among clear explanations drawn from a revelatory 
decade in biology.&quot;—Andrew H. Knoll, author of Life on a Young Planet </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
&quot;A beautifully written account of developmental evolution, integrating molecular 
and morphological information to describe clearly how highly complex organisms 
evolve through processes that facilitate variation.&nbsp;A tour de force.&quot;&nbsp;—James W. 
Valentine, author of On the Origin of Phyla </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
“One word comes to mind when I read this book: elegant. The authors have created 
an elegant essay/argument/overview of the subject of evolution.”—Margaret 
Lowman, author of Life in the Treetops: Adventures of a Woman in Field Biology</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
&quot;'Where does all the variation come from to explain the evolution of novel 
traits?' This book, written in simple yet engaging prose, provides an answer 
with a theory of facilitated variation.&quot;—Peter Grant, Princeton University&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
&quot;In this thought-provoking and lucidly written book, Marc Kirschner and John 
Gerhart address one of the most interesting, important,&nbsp;and yet difficult 
dimensions of evolutionary science—the origins of novelty.&nbsp; Drawing on a vast 
body of biological knowledge, from ant trails to the neural wiring of mouse 
whiskers, the authors illustrate how organisms are equipped to adapt to 
different and changing circumstances. They propose that variation, the raw 
material of evolution, is facilitated by newly understood&nbsp;properties of the 
development and physiology of organisms.&nbsp; This new view&nbsp;suggests that there is a 
bias in organisms capacity to evolve and in the directions that evolution 
takes.&nbsp; The Plausibility of Life will help&nbsp;readers understand not just the 
plausibility of evolution, but its remarkable, inventive powers.&quot;&nbsp;—Sean Carroll, 
author of Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
&quot;The Plausibility of Life is a brilliant effort to interpret evolutionary 
biology in the light of recent discoveries in genomics and developmental 
biology.&nbsp;It should be required reading for scientists and non-scientists 
alike.&quot;—Shirley M. Tilghman, Princeton University&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
&quot;<b>Complex living systems are plausible only if evolution can plausibly 
generate them.</b> The authors show how this has been achieved by providing many 
detailed examples to illustrate their theory of facilitated variation. They 
reveal what might be called the grammar of evolved systems, the flexible 
organization of processes which allows change by accretion and rearrangement. 
What emerges is the interesting consequence that it is life by design that is 
implausible.&quot;—Sydney Brenner, Salk Institute <br>
