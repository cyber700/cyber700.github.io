				<div class="entrytext">
					<font face="Verdana" size="2">I usually consider myself a 
					pretty circuitous guy, couching my statements in qualifying 
					if’s and maybe’s . But sometimes, something just needs to be 
					said, and needs to be said bluntly: In his recent
					<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/printables/fact/050530fa_fact">
					ID-critical article</a>, Allen Orr’s mouth is writing checks 
					the evidence can’t cash.</font><p><a id="more-104"></a>
					<font face="Verdana" size="2">Alluding to a molecular pump 
					known as the type three secretory system (TTSS), used by 
					bacteria for injecting poisons into other cells, Orr claims 
					that “there’s now strong evidence that several flagellar 
					proteins once played roles in a type of molecular pump found 
					in the membranes of bacterial cells.” OK, here’s the facts: 
					There’s strong evidence that the bacterial flagellum exists. 
					There’s strong evidence that the <span class="caps">TTSS</span> 
					also exists. And there’s strong evidence that the two 
					systems are related, as evidenced by the many similarities 
					between them. But as far as the majority of scientists 
					studying this relationship is regarded, <em>the
					<span class="caps">TTSS</span> is descended from the 
					flagellum</em>, not, as Orr claims, the other way around.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Robert Macnab, writing in 
					the <em>Journal of Bacteriology</em>, noted that, since 
					“[f]lagella are very ancient organelles, predating by far 
					the targets for bacterial pathogenesis”, it’s reasonable to 
					conclude that “the rest of the type <span class="caps">III</span> 
					pathways must have evolved from the flagellar one.” (1999, 
					7152) Mecsas and Strauss write: “The bacterial flagellum 
					exists in a wide range of eubacteria and some archaebacteria, 
					which indicates that it probably emerged well before 
					gram-negative bacteria, the hosts of the type
					<span class="caps">III</span> virulence factor secretion 
					systems identified thus far.” (1996, 280) Other researchers 
					taking this position are Stephens and Shapiro (1996) and 
					Nguyen, et al. (2000). In fact, the only dissenting voices 
					comes from Gohpna, Ron and Graur (2003), and they’re arguing 
					that the <span class="caps">TTSS</span> and the bacterial 
					flagellum are both descended from a third system.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">ID critics often seek to 
					portray themselves as Defenders of Science, protecting the 
					public against falsehoods from the “ID creationists”. But 
					Orr, in claiming “strong evidence” for a claim that is at 
					best controversial and at worst universally rejected in the 
					scientific community, is himself engaging in what can only 
					be described as a case of gross misrepresentation (whether 
					comitted knowingly or not). Also, it is often said that ID 
					proponents should get off their lazy butts and do the 
					scientific research necessary to test their claims. Well, 
					where’s Allen Orr doing research to test his non-consensus 
					claim that the flagellum is descended from the
					<span class="caps">TTSS</span>?</font></p>

					has a
					<a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/103">
					longer reply</a>, though more overbearing of Orr’s 
					misrepresentation.</font></p>

				<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From the abstract:</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<font face="Verdana" size="2">We review the biology of non-flagellar 
					type-III secretion systems from a Darwinian perspective, 
					highlighting the themes of evolution, conservation, 
					variation and decay. The presence of these systems in 
					environmental organisms such as Myxococcus, Desulfovibrio 
					and Verrucomicrobium hints at roles beyond virulence. We 
					review newly discovered sequence homologies (e.g., YopN/TyeA 
					and SepL). We discuss synapomorphies that might be useful in 
					formulating a taxonomy of type-III secretion. The problem of 
					information overload is likely to be ameliorated by launch 
					of a web site devoted to the comparative biology of type-III 
					secretion </font>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here is the pertinent passage:</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<font face="Verdana" size="2">If we accept the above 
					analysis, then parsimony demands that we also accept the 
					notion that the flagellar and non-flagellar systems have 
					evolved from a common ancestor, rather than the idea that 
					non-flagellar systems have evolved from flagellar systems. 
					The reasoning for this assertion is as follows. To get from 
					the common ancestor of all type-III secretion systems via a 
					flagellar system to a non-flagellar system would require 
					seven steps: gain of the motor, acquisition of the 
					chemotaxis apparatus and recruitment of the sigma/anti-sigma 
					mechanism during the evolution of the flagellar system, and 
					then, in the lineage leading to the NF-T3SSs, loss of the 
					motor, uncoupling from the chemotaxis apparatus and demise 
					of the sigma/anti-sigma mechanism, followed by gain of the 
					translocation apparatus. However, if the flagellar and non-flagellar 
					systems diverged from a common ancestor, then we need posit 
					only four steps: gain of the motor, gain of the chemotaxis 
					apparatus and gain of the sigma/anti-sigma mechanism in the 
					flagellar lineage, and gain of the translocation apparatus 
					in the non-flagellar lineage.</font></blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for Orr’s remarks, I’m not 
				sure you can justify saying he is ‘misrepresenting science’. If 
				the modern <span class="caps">TTSS</span> and the flagellum are 
				descended from a common ancestor, then that ancestor may very 
				well have been a <span class="caps">TTSS</span>-like secretion 
				system. If so, then Orr’s remarks are well within that 
				interpretation.</font></p>

				<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hi KC,</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nice to see you here. Also, 
				thanks for the reference, which I hadn’t seen when I wrote my 
				post. However, my point that Orr was misrepresenting the 
				research on this area still stands. I took account of the 
				“flagellum and secretory system both evolving from a common 
				ancestory” position when I wrote, “Orr, in claiming “strong 
				evidence” for a claim that is <strong>at best controversial</strong> 
				and at worst universally rejected in the scientific community, 
				is himself engaging in what can only be described as a case of 
				gross misrepresentation (whether comitted knowingly or not).”
