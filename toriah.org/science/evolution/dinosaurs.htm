			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What is a fossil? 
			Although many definitions of &quot;fossil&quot; (derived from the Latin word 
			for &quot;dug up&quot;) have been published, one of the best is that fossils 
			are simply any evidence of extinct life. Bones do not have to be 
			&quot;turned into stone&quot; to be fossils, and usually most of the original 
			bone is present in a dinosaur fossil. Footprints, the impressions 
			left in mud, as well as dung and eggs, are some of the other common 
			types of dinosaur fossils. Although the horny beaks of hadrosaurs 
			(duckbilled dinosaurs), cartilage at the ends of long bones, and 
			skin usually decompose before they have an opportunity to fossilize, 
			these things are sometimes pre-served. Most remarkable, perhaps, is 
			the recent discovery that ancient genetic material, including DNA, 
			can be extracted from dinosaur teeth, bones and eggs.</font></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fossilization is a 
			process that can take anything from a few hours to millions of 
			years. &quot;Fossilized&quot; bone is usually considered to be that which has 
			&quot;turned to stone.&quot; The process is called permineralization. When a 
			bone becomes buried, groundwater seeps through all of the pores and 
			openings to invade the spaces inside. Minerals carried by the water 
			are deposited inside these spaces, and over time can fill them in 
			completely. This is similar to what happens in the sediments around 
			the bone, where minerals carried in solution are deposited in the 
			spaces to cement sand grains together to form sandstones, silts into 
			siltstones, and so on. The amount of time that it takes for a bone 
			to become completely permineralized is highly variable. If the 
			groundwater is heavily laden with minerals in solution, the process 
			can happen rapidly. <b>Modern bones that fall into mineral springs 
			can become permineralized within a matter of weeks. The preservation 
			of soft tissues in some dinosaurs also suggests that, under 
			exceptional circumstances, fossilization can occur within days. </b>
			Some of the more common minerals found in permineralized bone are 
			cal-cite, iron, phosphate and silica. Virtually any mineral that can 
			be carried in solution in water can be found in fossilized hones, 
			however. Dinosaur bones found in northeastern Colorado contain 
			enough uranium to be located by a geiger counter. Dinosaur bones are 
			not always permineralized, however. In Dinosaur Provincial Park in 
			Alberta, dinosaur hones were sometimes encased in ironstone nodules 
			shortly after they were buried 75 million years ago. The nodules 
			prevented water from invading the bones, which for all intents and 
			purposes cannot he distinguished from modern bone. <b>A more 
			spectacular example was found on the North Slope of Alaska, where 
			many thousands of hones lack any significant degree of 
			perrnineralization. The bones look and feel like old cow bones, and 
			the discoverers of the site did not report it for twenty years 
			because they assumed they were bison, not dinosaur, bones</b>.</font></p>

			HADROSAUR BONES have been found on the Colville River north of Umiat 
			on the North Slope of Alaska. This find represents the first report 
			of dinosaur bones in Alaska and their northernmost reported 
			occurrence. ...</font></p>
			<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px">
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">The hadrosaur bones were collected in 
			1961 by the late R. L. Liscomb while working for Shell Oil Company. 
			Renewed research around the Colville River led to the bones being 
			sent to the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, where they were 
			tentatively identified as <b>hadrosaurian</b> by C. Repenning. He 
			sent the bones to the Texas Memorial Museum for further 
			investigation, and the Shell Oil Company was kind enough to donate 
			the bones to TMM for safekeeping. The bones were found on the 
			Colville River at approximately 70°N, 151 °W (Figure 1), and the 
			site was relocated in 1984 by two U.S. Geological Survey field 
			parties (C. Repenning, personal common.). The site is easily 
			accessible by float plane or helicopter, common means of 
			transportation in the area, and to deter possible vandalism it is 
			felt best not to reveal the exact location of the site. Precise 
			locality information is on file at TMM.</font></p>
			<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px">
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">The site occurs in what is mapped as 
			undifferentiated Upper Colville Group of Late <b>Cretaceous</b> age, 
			which is overlain by the Plio(?)-Pleistocene Gubik Formation (Brosge 
			and Whittington, 1966). Recent studies. however, have indicated 
			Paleogene rocks in this region (Carter et al., 1977; Nelson, 1981: 
			Marincovich et al., 1983). Pending resolution of the stratigraphy, 
			beds underlying the Gubik Formation in the region are being referred 
			to simply as &quot;pre-Gubik&quot; (Carter et al., 1977; R. V. Emmons, 
			personal commun.). Hadrosaurs are exclusively Late Cretaceous and 
			their presence limits the age of the pre-Gubik rocks. &quot;This datum 
			has allowed H. J. Clippinger to interpret somewhat contaminated 
			pollen samples and establish a Maastrichtian or possibly Campanian 
			age for the strata 28 feet above and 12 feet below the dinosaur bed. 
			Foraminifera 2 feet below the bone bed indicate a shallow marine 
			environment&quot; (Shell Oil Company memorandum, with per-mission of R. 
			V. Emmons and H. J. Clippinger).</font></p>

			<font face="Verdana" size="2">Shell Oil Company's stratigraphic 
			section of the locality shows <b>the fossil bones come from a thin

			<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px">
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">The bones, catalogued as TMM 42475-1. 
			apparently represent <b>a quick surface collection</b> by Liscomb, 
			and consist of fragments of limb bones, ribs, and vertebrae. <b>The 
			quality of preservation is remarkable</b>. The bones are stained a 
			dark red brown but otherwise display little permineralization, 
			crushing, or distortion. None of the diagnostic cranial or pelvic 
			bones were recovered, so determination below family level is not
