						<a style="color: #58a; text-decoration: none" href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/hacb/staff/Crompton.R.html">
						Robin Crompton</a> of the University of Liverpool, have 
						attempted to settle the question whether `Lucy' was 
						fully bipedal (walked fully upright with a striding 
						gait), as we modern humans do, a question that 
						anthropologists still disagree on.<br>
						<br>
						`<a style="color: #58a; text-decoration: none" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_afarensis">Lucy</a>' 
						is the name given to the ~3.2 million-year ago <i>
						Australopithecus afarensis</i> 40% complete fossil 
						skeleton discovered at Hadar in Ethiopia by Donald 
						Johanson in 1974. This fossil, together with the ~3.5

						Laetoli footprints</a> preserved in volcanic ash that 
						were discovered in Tanzania in 1978, and presumed to be 
						made by an <i>A. afarensis</i>, were the earliest 
						evidence of full bipedality in a presumed human 
						ancestor.<br>
						<br>
						As they reported in the journal
						<a style="color: #58a; text-decoration: none" href="http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/link.asp?id=e0lqc88dxv72uagq">
						Royal Society Interface</a>, Sellers and colleagues 
						built a robotics model, with assumed virtual muscles for 
						`Lucy', that used genetic algorithms to determined the 
						optimum locomotion for a particular set of body 
						proportions. The resulting model of <i>A. afarensis</i> 
						locomotion closely matched that of the Laetoli 
						footprints. The researchers
						<a style="color: #58a; text-decoration: none" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4697977.stm">
						concluded</a>, &quot;Assuming that the early human relative
						<i>A. afarensis</i> was the maker of the Laetoli 
						footprint, our study suggests that, by 3.5 million years 
						ago, some, at least, of our early relatives, despite 
						small stature, could sustain efficient bipedal walking 
						at absolute speeds within the range shown by modern 
						humans.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						<b>Bipedality <i>too</i> early!: A problem of evolution</b><br>
						<br>
						This study further confirms what has been a a 
						long-standing problem of evolution, that Lucy's 
						bipedality is <i>too</i> early for Darwinian evolution. 
						The
						<a style="color: #58a; text-decoration: none" href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s1421564.htm">
						ABC</a> article touches on this: &quot;By suggesting that our 
						ancestors walked upright before the earliest stone tools 
						were made and before brains got bigger, the prediction 
						conflicts with the previous hypothesis that <i>A. 
						afarensis</i> shuffled like chimps walking upright.&quot; The 
						original Darwinian gradualistic explanation was that 
						hominid bipedalism was an adaptation to living and 
						hunting on the savannah grasslands that opened up in 
						Africa with the drying of the climate at the 
						Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary about 5 million years ago. 
						However, this &quot;Darwinian package of bipedalism, tool 
						making, and intelligence marching in evolutionary 
						concert is not correct&quot; because Lucy showed that 
						bipedalism occurred well before &quot;the great plains and 
						the immense herds on them [that] are relatively recent 
						aspects of the African environment&quot; (Leakey &amp; Lewin, 
						pp.84-85). The problem for evolution is that: </font>
						</p>
						<blockquote style="margin: 1em 20px">
							<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The evolutionary 
							shift from quadrupedalism to bipedalism would have 
							required an extensive remodeling of the ape's bone 
							and muscle architecture and of the overall 
							proportion in the lower half of the body. Mechanisms 
							of gait are different, mechanics of balance are 
							different, functions of major muscles are 
							different-an entire functional complex had to be 
							transformed for efficient bipedalism to be 
							possible.&quot; (Leakey &amp; Lewin, 1993, pp.83-84).</font></blockquote>
						<font face="Verdana">However, it gets even <i>worse</i> 
						for evolution, with recently discovered hominid fossils 
						that appear to be bipedal, <i>three million years before 
						Lucy</i>, as no less than Dawkins acknowledges:<br>
&nbsp;</font><blockquote style="margin: 1em 20px">
							<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;WHATEVER THE REASON 
							for the evolution of bipedality, recent fossil 
							discoveries seem to indicate that hominids were 
							already bipedal at a date which is pushing 
							disconcertingly close to Rendezvous 1, the fork 
							between ourselves and chimpanzees (disconcerting 
							because it seems to leave little time for bipedality 
							to evolve). In the year 2000, a French team led by 
							Brigitte Senut and Martin Pickford announced a new 
							fossil from the Tugen Hills, east of Lake Victoria 
							in Kenya. Dubbed `Millennium Man; dated at 6 million 
							years and given yet another new generic name, <i>
							Orrorin tugenensis</i> was also, according to its 
							discoverers, bipedal. Indeed, they claim that the 
							top of its femur, near the hip joint, was more 
							human-like than that of <i>Australopithecus</i>. 
							This evidence, supplemented by fragments of skull 
							bones, suggested to Senut and Pickford that orrorins 
							are ancestral to later hominids and that Lucy's are 
							not. These French workers go further and suggest 
							that <i>Ardipithecus </i>might be ancestral to 
							modern chimpanzees rather than to us. Clearly we 
							need more fossils to settle these arguments. Other 
							scientists are sceptical of these French claims, and 
							some doubt that there is enough evidence to show 
							whether <i>Orrorin</i> was or was not bipedal. If it 
							was, since 6 million years is approximately the time 
							of the split from chimpanzees according to molecular 
							evidence, this raises difficult questions about the 
							speed with which bipedality must have arisen. If a 
							bipedal <i>Orrorin</i> pushes back alarmingly close 
							to Rendezvous 1, a newly discovered skull from Chad 
							in southern Sahara, found by another French team led 
							by Michel Brunet, is even more disturbing to 
							accepted ideas. This is partly because it is so old, 
							and partly because the site is far to the west of 
							the Rift Valley (as we shall see, many authorities 
							had thought early hominid evolution confined to the 
							east of the Rift). Nicknamed <i>Toumai</i> (Hope of 
							Life in the local Goran language) its official name 
							is <i>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</i> after the Sahel 
							region of the Sahara in Chad where it was found. ... 
							If their discoverers are right that <i>Orrorin</i> 
							and <i>Toumai</i> were bipedal, this poses problems 
							to any tidy view of human origins. The naive 
							expectation is that evolutionary change spreads 
							itself uniformly to fill the time available for it. 
							If 6 million years elapsed between Rendezvous 1 and 
							modern <i>Homo sapiens</i>, the quantity of change 
							ought to be spun out, <i>pro rata</i> one might 
							naively think, through the 6 million years. But <i>
							Orrorin</i> and <i>Toumai</i> both lived very close 
							to the date identified from molecular evidence as 
							that of Concestor 1, the split between our line and 
							that of chimpanzees.&quot; (Dawkins, 2004, pp.94-96).</font></blockquote>
						<font face="Verdana">Note Dawkins' words: 
						&quot;disconcerting,&quot; &quot;alarmingly,&quot; &quot;disturbing&quot;, &quot;problems&quot;! 
						To resolve the problem, Dawkins considers several 
						possibilities, including: </font>
						<blockquote style="margin: 1em 20px">
							<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;An extremely rapid 
							burst of evolution occurred immediately after 
							Concestor 1, which itself walked on all fours like a 
							chimpanzee. The more humanoid <i>Toumai</i> and <i>
							Orrorin</i> evolved their bipedality so swiftly 
							after Concestor 1 that the separation in dates 
							cannot easily be resolved. ... We shall learn from 
							the Galapagos Finch's Tale and the Lungfish's Tale 
							that evolution can be extremely rapid or can be 
							extremely slow. So [this] ... is not implausible.&quot; 
							Dawkins, 2004, p.97).</font></blockquote>
						<font face="Verdana">However, Dawkins forgets what he 
						once wrote:<br>
&nbsp;</font><blockquote style="margin: 1em 20px">
							<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;To 'tame' chance 
							means to break down the very improbable into less 
							improbable small components arranged in series. No 
							matter how improbable it is that an X could have 
							arisen from a Y in a single step, it is always 
							possible to conceive of a series of infinitesimally 
							graded intermediates between them. However 
							improbable a large-scale change may be, smaller 
							changes are less improbable. And provided we 
							postulate a sufficiently large series of 
							sufficiently finely graded intermediates, we shall 
							be able to derive anything from anything else, 
							without invoking astronomical improbabilities. We 
							are allowed to do this <i>only if there has been 
							sufficient time</i> to fit all the intermediates in. 
							And also only if there is a mechanism for guiding 
							each step in some particular direction, otherwise 
							the sequence of steps will career off in an endless 
							random walk. It is the contention of the Darwinian 
							world-view that both these provisos are met, and 
							that <i>slow, gradual</i>, cumulative natural 
							selection is the ultimate explanation for our 
							existence. If there are versions of the evolution 
							theory that deny <i>slow gradualism</i>, and deny 
							the central role of natural selection, they may be 
							true in particular cases. But they cannot be the 
							whole truth, for they deny <i>the very heart</i> of 
							the evolution theory, which gives it the power to 
							dissolve astronomical improbabilities and <i>explain 
							prodigies of apparent miracle</i>.&quot; (Dawkins, 1986, 
							pp.317-318. My emphasis)</font></blockquote>
						<font face="Verdana">So Dawkins, like Darwin, when it 
						comes to the crunch, is prepared to abandon natural 
						selection, in order to save &quot;evolution.&quot; That is, for 
						Dawkins, like Darwin (who abandoned slow gradualism in 
						the last edition of his <i>Origin of Species</i>, to 
						accommodate the physicist Lord Kelvin's ~100 
						million-year estimate of the age of the Earth - Darwin, 
						1872, p.315):<br>
&nbsp;</font><blockquote style="margin: 1em 20px">
							<font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&quot;Darwinism, 
							therefore, began as a theory that evolution could be 
							explained by natural selection. It ended as a theory 
							that evolution could be explained just as you would 
							like it to be explained.&quot; (Darlington, 1959, p.60)</font>!</font></blockquote>
