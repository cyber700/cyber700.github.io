<br>
The defense of Darwin’s theory of evolution has now fallen into the hands of 
biologists who believe in suppressing criticism when possible and ignoring it 
when not. It is not a strategy calculated in induce confidence in the scientific 
method. A paper published recently in the Proceedings of the Biological Society 
of Washington concluded that the events taking place during the Cambrian era 
could best be understood in terms of an intelligent design – hardly a position 
unknown in the history of western science. The paper was, of course, 
peer-reviewed by three prominent evolutionary biologists. Wise men attend to the 
publication of every one of the Proceeding’s papers, but in the case of Steven 
Meyer’s &quot;The origin of biological information and the higher taxonomic 
categories,&quot; the Board of Editors was at once given to understand that they had 
done a bad thing. Their indecent capitulation followed at once. <br>
<br>
Publication of the paper, they confessed, was a mistake. It would never happen 
again. It had barely happened at all. And peer review?<br>
<br>
The hell with it.<br>
<br>
“If scientists do not oppose antievolutionism,” Eugenie Scott, the Executive 
Director of the National Center for Science Education, remarked, “it will reach 
more people with the mistaken idea that evolution is scientifically weak.” 
Scott’s understanding of ‘opposition’ had nothing to do with reasoned 
discussion. It had nothing to do with reason at all. Discussing the issue was 
out of the question. Her advice to her colleagues was considerably more to the 
point: &quot;Avoid debates.&quot; <br>
<br>
Everyone else had better shut up. <br>
<br>
In this country, at least, no one is ever going to shut up, the more so since 
the case against Darwin’s theory retains an almost lunatic vitality. <br>
<br>
Look – The suggestion that Darwin’s theory of evolution is like theories in the 
serious sciences – quantum electrodynamics, say – is grotesque. Quantum 
electrodynamics is accurate to thirteen unyielding decimal places. Darwin’s 
theory makes no tight quantitative predictions at all.<br>
<br>
Look – Field studies attempting to measure natural selection inevitably report 
weak to non-existent selection effects. <br>
<br>
Look – Darwin’s theory is open at one end since there are no plausible account 
for the origins of life.<br>
<br>
Look – The astonishing and irreducible complexity of various cellular structures 
has not yet successfully been described, let alone explained.<br>
<br>
Look – A great many species enter the fossil record trailing no obvious 
ancestors and depart for Valhalla leaving no obvious descendents. <br>
<br>
Look – Where attempts to replicate Darwinian evolution on the computer have been 
successful, they have not used classical Darwinian principles, and where they 
have used such principles, they have not been successful. <br>
<br>
Look – Tens of thousands of fruit flies have come and gone in laboratory 
experiments, and every last one of them has remained a fruit fly to the end, all 
efforts to see the miracle of speciation unavailing. <br>
<br>
Look – The remarkable similarity in the genome of a great many organisms 
suggests that there is at bottom only one living system; but how then to account 
for the astonishing differences between human beings and their near relatives – 
differences that remain obvious to anyone who has visited a zoo?<br>
<br>
But look again – If the differences between organisms are scientifically more 
interesting than their genomic similarities, of what use is Darwin’s theory 
since it’s otherwise mysterious operations take place by genetic variations? <br>
These are hardly trivial questions. Each suggests a dozen others. These are 
hardly circumstances that do much to support the view that there are “no valid 
criticisms of Darwin’s theory,” as so many recent editorials have suggested.<br>
<br>
Serious biologists quite understand all this. They rather regard Darwin’s theory 
as an elderly uncle invited to a family dinner. The old boy has no hair, he has 
no teeth, he is hard of hearing, and he often drools. Addressing even senior 
members at table as Sonny, he is inordinately eager to tell the same story over 
and over again.<br>
<br>
But he’s family. What can you do?</font><br>

<span class="bodyText" id="content">Like Hell itself, Darwin’s theory of 
evolution is often said to be protected by walls that are at least seven miles 
thick, in that it is not only true, but unassailable. It is a considerable 
irony, therefore, that some of the most cogent criticisms of Darwin’s theory are 
the result of work undertaken by very orthodox members of the biological 
establishment itself. Such criticisms are inevitably designated as calls for 
further research. They are, nonetheless, what they are.<br>
<br>
A recent study by J.G. Kingsolver et al (hereinafter Kingsolver) entitled <i>‘<a href="articles/kingsolver-american-naturalist-march-2001.pdf">The 
Strength of Phenotypic Selection in Natural Populations</a>,</i> published in 
the March 2001 issue of <i>The American Naturalist</i>, is an interesting 
example. It is field studies of natural selection that is at issue in this 
study. Such studies are addressed to living species under natural conditions, 
and it comes as something of a surprise to learn that despite very long-standing 
claims by evolutionary biologists to have established the robust viability of 
natural selection as a biological force, the overwhelming number of such studies 
have been conducted only in the past fifteen years.<br>
<br>
Kingsolver’s study is second-order in nature: It analyses and discusses sixty 
three field studies dealing with sixty two species that have been reported in 
the literature since the publication of J.A. Endler’s well-known monograph, <i>
Natural Selection in the Wild</i>, published in 1986. <br>
<br>
The statistical methods by which Kingsolver proceeded are simple to the point of 
triteness. One the one hand, there are a series of quantitative biological 
traits, chiefly morphological in nature; and on the other hand, certain 
quantitative measure of fitness. Beak length in finches is a typical 
morphological trait, and survival, mating success or fecundity typical measure 
of fitness. Using the methodology first introduced by R. Lande and S. J. Arnold 
in their 1983 study, <i>‘The Measurement of selection on correlated 
characteristics,’</i> published in Evolution, 37, Kingsolver proposed to define 
selection in terms of the slope of the regression between a quantitative trait 
of interest and specific measures of fitness. This provides an estimate of the 
strength of selection.<br>
<br>
Natural selection disappears as a biological force and reappears as a 
statistical artifact. The change is not trivial. It is one thing to say that 
nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution; it is quite 
another thing to say that nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of 
various regression correlations between quantitative characteristics. It hardly 
appears obvious that if natural selection is simply a matter of correlations 
established between quantitative traits, that Darwin’s theory has any content 
beyond the phenomenological, and in the most obvious sense, is no theory at all.<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, the real burden of Kingsolver’s study lies in the 
quantitative conclusions it reaches. Two correlations are at issue. The first is 
linear, and corresponds to what in population genetics is called directional 
selection; and the second quadratic, and corresponds either to stabilizing or 
disruptive selection. These are the cornerstones of the modern hill and valley 
model of much of mathematical population genetics. Kingsolver reported a median 
absolute value of 0.16 for linear selection, and a median absolute value of 0.10 
for quadratic selection. Thus an increase of one standard deviation in, say, 
beak finch length, could be expected to change fitness by only 16 percent in the 
case of linear selection, and 10 percent in the case of quadratic selection. 
These figures are commonly understood to represent a very weak correlation. Thus 
if a change in the length of a beak’s finch by one standard deviation explains 
16 percent of the change in the population’s fitness, 84 percent of the change 
is not explained by selection at all.<br>
<br>
These results, although at odds with those reported by Endler, are not in 
themselves astounding. It is when sample sizes pass beyond samples of 1000 that 
results become far more difficult to accommodate, for under these circumstances, 
Kingsolver reported, both linear and quadratic selection were virtually 
non-existent.<br>
<br>
The significance of these results is, of course, not entirely clear. Kingsolver 
goes no further than observing that “important issues about selection remain 
unresolved.” Considering the fundamental role of both linear and quadratic 
selection in population genetics and in popular accounts of Darwin’s theory, one 
of those “unresolved” issues may well be whether natural selection exists to any 
appreciable extent, and if it does, whether it plays any real role in biological 
change altogether.<br>
<br>
These considerations may assume some importance when it comes to assessing the 
widely repeated claim that Darwin’s theory is as well-established as physical 
theories such as general relativity or quantum mechanics</span></font></p>
