<p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the classic cases cited by Darwinists of 
supposed maladaptation in nature is the inverted design of the vertebrate 
retina.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In all non-vertebrate eyes, and in the pineal or 
dorsal eyes of primitive vertebrates, the photoreceptors point toward the light. 
However, in the vertebrate lateral eye, the photoreceptors point backwards away 
from the light towards the retinal epithelium and the choroidal blood sinuses. 
This arrangement necessitates the placement of the neural cell layer--which 
relays the visual image from the retina to the brain--between the photoreceptors 
and the light, and results in the blind spot where the axons of these neural 
cells leave the retina for the brain via the optic nerve.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Generations of Darwinists have seized on this 
apparently illogical arrangement and particularly the consequent “blind spot” as 
a case of maladaptation. The following comments by Dawkins are typical:<a href="#anchor4039228">1</a></font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Times New Roman">Any engineer would naturally assume that the 
	photocells would point towards the light, with their wires leading backwards 
	towards the brain. He would laugh at any suggestion that the photocells 
	might point away from the light, with their wires departing on the side <i>
	nearest</i> the light. Yet this is exactly what happens in all vertebrate 
	eyes. Each photocell is, in effect, wired in backwards, with its wires 
	sticking out on the side nearest to the light. This means that the light, 
	instead of being granted an unrestricted passage to the photocells, has to 
	pass through a forest of connecting wires, presumably suffering at least 
	some attenuation and distortion (actually probably not much but, still, it 
	is the <i>principle</i> of the thing that would offend any tidy-minded 
	engineer!)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Vision is such an important adaptation in higher 
vertebrates that if the retina is indeed “wired wrongly” or “badly designed” it 
would certainly pose, as Dawkins implies, a considerable challenge to any 
teleological interpretation of nature.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">However, consideration of the very high energy 
demands of the photoreceptor cells in the vertebrate retina suggests that rather 
than being a challenge to teleology the curious inverted design of the 
vertebrate retina may in fact represent a unique solution to the problem of 
providing the highly active photoreceptor cells of higher vertebrates with 
copious quantities of oxygen and nutrients.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The mammalian photoreceptor is capable of 
generating a measurable electrical response to a single photon of light--the 
minimal bundle of light energy. This remarkable capacity is dependent on a 
complex catalytic cascade consisting of a series of enzymes in the photoreceptor 
cell which massively amplifies the initial signal--the absorption by a single 
rhodopsin molecule of a single photon.<a href="#anchor4039433">2</a> This 
amplification process requires vast quantities of metabolic energy and 
consequently the photoreceptor layer has one of the highest metabolic rates of 
any known tissue.<a href="#anchor4039714">3</a> The oxygen consumption of the 
mammalian retina (per gram of tissue) is nearly 50% greater than that of the 
kidney, three times greater than the cerebral cortex and six times that of 
cardiac muscle.<a href="#anchor4039940">4</a> Moreover, because most of the 
metabolic activity of the retina is concentrated in the photoreceptor layer<a href="#anchor4040252">5</a>--comprising 
less than half of the total mass of the retina--it is clear that the oxygen 
demands (per gram of tissue) of the photoreceptors are comparatively greater 
than such whole retinal estimates imply. Walls describes the photoreceptors in 
his classic <i>The Vertebrate Eye</i> as “greedy,”<a href="#anchor4040470">6</a> 
and greedy they are for both nutrients and oxygen (See <a href="#anchor4085840">
Fig. 2</a>). Indeed the high acuity and high sensitivity of the visual system in 
higher vertebrates is critically dependent on the very high metabolic rates of 
the photoreceptor cells.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The oxygen and nutrients for the voracious 
metabolic appetite of the photoreceptors are provided by a unique capillary bed, 
called the choriocapillaris, which is an anastomosing network of large and 
flattened capillaries which form a rich vascular layer situated immediately 
external to the photoreceptors,<a href="#anchor4040698">7</a> separated from 
them only by the retinal cell epithelial cell layer (RPE) and a special 
membrane--Bruch’s membrane--which together form a highly selective barrier which 
only allows passage into the retina of metabolites and nutrients required for 
the function of the RPE and photoreceptor cells. These capillaries are much 
larger than standard capillaries being between 18–50 microns in diameter.<a href="#anchor4041074">8</a> 
This unique network of blood channels gives every impression of being specially 
adapted to provide the photoreceptor layer with copious quantities of blood. 
Moreover, the lining of the capillaries is attenuated on the side closest to the 
photoreceptor cells--another indication that their fundamental purpose is the 
rapid and efficient delivery of nutrients to the photoreceptor layer. A 
beautiful illustration of this unique capillary bed, showing how it differs from 
a standard type capillary bed, is shown in Adler’s <i>Physiology of the Eye</i> 
(see Figure 1).<a href="#anchor4041333">9</a> Not only does the choriocapillaris 
give every appearance of being specially adapted for the provision of a copious 
supply of blood to the photoreceptors, it is a surprising and little-known fact 
that as much as 80% of the blood supply to the eye in mammals is carried through 
these remarkable choroidal vessels. (The retinal artery which enters the eye 
through the optic disc and supplies the neural layer--in front of the 
photoreceptor layer--carries only about 5% of the retinal blood supply.)<a href="#anchor4041738">10</a> 
As Walls puts it, “The blood filled tubing of the choroid exists solely in order 
to maintain a rich blood flow in the choriocapillaris and the latter exists 
solely to nourish the retina--with special reference to the greedy rod-cone 
layer.”<a href="#anchor4042109">11</a></font></p>

<hr align="left">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of the relatively massive blood flow 
through the choroidal capillary system, there is only a 3% difference in oxygen 
tension between the arterial and venous ends of the choroidal capillary system. 
This is virtually unique and contrasts with most capillary systems where the 
decrease may be up to 50%. In the case of the retinal system, for example, the 
decrease in oxygen content between the arterial and venous ends is given in some 
studies as 38%.<a href="#anchor4042376">12</a> As one authority puts it “Because 
of the great metabolic needs of the photoreceptors, the eye seems to have 
adopted the strategy of ‘swamping’ the choroid with blood to ensure that supply 
is never a problem.”<a href="#anchor4042793">13</a> In effect the photoreceptors 
are virtually bathed in arterial blood at all times. But remarkably, despite 
this very copious blood supply, oxygen tension drops across the photoreceptor 
from near arterial levels in the choroidal capillaries to close to zero near the 
inner segments, another indication of the very high metabolic demands of 
phototransduction.<a href="#anchor4043064">14</a>, <a href="#anchor4043262">15</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The remarkable capacity of the unique 
choriocapillaris system to deliver copious quantities of oxygen to the 
photoreceptors has an important consequence--it obligates the necessity for a 
capillary network within the photoreceptor layer and this in turn allows the 
photoreceptor cells to be packed tightly together, thus maximizing the resolving 
power of the eye. It is also hard to imagine how a standard-type capillary 
network to carry the necessary quantities of blood directly through the 
photoreceptor cell layer could be arranged without causing at least some 
decrease in the packing density of the photoreceptors and a consequent decrease 
in the resolving power of the eye. (Interestingly, in all known high-acuity 
eyes, including the compound eyes of insects and other arthropods and the 
camera-type eyes of various groups, including the cephalopod and photoreceptors, 
are packed tightly together and not separated by either blood vessels or any 
other type of intervening tissues or structures.)</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Taken together, the evidence strongly supports 
the notion that the inverted retina and its major consequence (the positioning 
of the photoreceptors in the outer section of the retina where they are in 
intimate contact with the choriocapillaris) is a specific adaptation designed to 
deliver abundant quantities of oxygen to the photoreceptor cells commensurate 
with their high energy demands--especially in metabolically active groups such 
as the birds and mammals. Rather than being a case of maladaptation, the 
inverted retina is probably an essential element in the overall design of the 
vertebrate visual system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This conclusion is reinforced by the difficulty 
of envisaging alternative means of delivering the required amounts of oxygen to 
the photoreceptor cell layer if the retina had the typical non-inverted design 
of the sort that might appeal to a “tidy-minded engineer.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Blood absorbs light strongly, as witnessed by 
the fact that in the area centralis or macular region--which is the high-visual 
acuity part of the vertebrate retina--the density of the retinal arterioles and 
capillaries is often at a minimum or completely excluded. From this we can 
immediately discount one possible way of supplying the photoreceptors in a 
non-inverted retina where the photoreceptor would form the inner layer--pointing 
directly towards the light, i.e., by placing a choriocapillaris-type system of 
blood vessels in front of the photoreceptor cells, i.e., between the 
photoreceptors and the light. While such an arrangement might well deliver 
sufficient quantities of oxygen to the photoreceptors, the sensitivity and 
acuity of any such hypothetical “eye” would be greatly diminished by the highly 
absorbent complex of blood vessels positioned between the light and the 
photoreceptor layer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Positioning a choriocapillaris or some 
equivalent system immediately behind the photoreceptor layer in a non-inverted 
retina would appear to be feasible alternative way of delivering oxygen to the 
photoreceptors but such an arrangement would place the retinal epithelium in a 
disadvantageous position to carry out its various functions involved in 
supporting and sustaining the photoreceptor cells including the phagocytosing 
and recycling the photoreceptor discs. In the inverted retina the retinal 
epithelium, situated between the choriocapillaris and the photoreceptors, is 
ideally placed to carry out these functions and to control the flow of 
metabolites, including vitamin A, to and from the choriocapillaris to the rods 
and cones. Indeed, in the inverted retina the retinal epithelium and the outer 
sections of the photoreceptor cells form a relatively isolated and distinct 
metabolic compartment sealed off on the inner side by the outer limiting 
membrane and on the outer side by the epithelium cells themselves. Also, in the 
inverted retina, the epithelium, positioned between the blood sinuses of the 
choroid and the retina, can function as part of the general blood-brain barrier 
controlling the flow of metabolites from the choroid into the inner regions of 
the retina. The need to maintain a blood-brain barrier may also mitigate against 
the hypothetical placement of a rich vascular bed between the photoreceptor 
layer and the neural retina.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The more deeply the design of the vertebrate 
retina is considered the more it appears that virtually every feature is 
necessary and that in redesigning from first principles an eye capable of the 
highest possible resolution (within the constraints imposed by the wavelength of 
light<a href="#anchor4043474">16</a>) and of the highest possible sensitivity 
(capable of detecting an individual photon of light) we would end up recreating 
the vertebrate eye--complete with an inverted retina and a choriocapillaris 
separated from the photoreceptor layer by a supportive epithelium layer and so 
forth. (A more complete justification of this viewpoint is not possible here and 
is being prepared for publication elsewhere.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, there is the fascinating question of 
pre-adaptation. Although all vertebrates have the same inverted design the 
interesting question arises as to whether the inverted design is a necessity for 
high-resolution vision in the cold-blooded vertebrates such as fish which have 
lower metabolic rates than the warm-blooded vertebrates such as mammals and 
birds. In this context the high resolution eye of the cephalopods, including the 
octopus and squid, is instructive. The cephalopods have a typical non-inverted 
retina which is comparable in resolving power to the eyes of many vertebrates,<a href="#anchor4043689">17</a> 
have metabolic rates similar to that of fish and other cold-blooded vertebrates 
(even though the maximum oxygen capacity of cephalopod blood is only one third 
that of a fish),<a href="#anchor4043900">18</a> and inhabit an aquatic 
environment similar to that of many fish. This implies strongly that high-acuity 
vision in the eyes of cold-blooded vertebrates would be possible with a 
non-inverted retina and that it is only in the case of the higher and 
warm-blooded vertebrate species where the metabolic rates are far higher that 
the inverted arrangement to bring the photoreceptors adjacent to the choroidal 
vessels is a necessity for phototransduction. In other words, the inverted 
retinal design is almost certainly not an adaptive necessity in cold-blooded 
vertebrates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It would seem that rather than being one of the 
classic “evidences” for undirected evolution and for maladaptation, the 
inversion of the retina is in fact highly problematic in terms of undirected 
models of evolution. Why on any undirected model should such an unlikely, 
improbable arrangement--unique in the animal kingdom--have appeared in the first 
place some 600 million years ago in the earliest of vertebrates who had 
presumably no need for high acuity vision and in all probability possessed 
photoreceptors with metabolic rates perhaps one or two orders of magnitude less 
than those of higher warm-blooded vertebrates today? If the non-inverted retina 
works so well for the cold-blooded cephalopods why did evolution go to such 
trouble to invert the retina in cold-blooded vertebrates? And is it really just 
fortuity that this curious event resulted in an adaptation which turned out to 
be essential for high acuity vision in the most advanced terrestrial vertebrates 
that appeared on earth long after this remarkable choice was made.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Rather than being a case of maladaptation, the 
inverted design of the vertebrate retina would seem to be a classic case of 
pre-adaptation--where an ancient adaptation was “chosen” long before its utility 
was of necessity. It is evidence for design and foresight in nature rather than 
evidence of chance. Evidently not all “tidy-minded engineers” get things right.</font></p>
