				be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not 
				possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight 
				modifications, my theory would absolutely break down...&quot;</i></font> 
				<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Simply put, Michael Behe has 
				found such a case. He reasons that a cell can only function as a 
				complete unit. That means a cell is unable to function if it 
				gradually comes into existence by means of evolution. He uses a 
				mouse trap as an example. A mouse trap does not function if 
				parts are missing. All the various parts have to be assembled in 
				the right position for the mouse trap to work smoothly. In this 
				sense, a cell can only function if all the 'parts' (or systems)

				'irreducible complexity' of a cell. If only one minor fragment

		many biological structures proteins are simply components of larger 
		molecular machines. Like the picture tube, wires, metal bolts and screws 
		that comprise a television set, many proteins are part of structures 
		that only function when virtually all of the components have been 
		assembled. A good example of this is a <b>Cilium.&nbsp;</b> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font>

		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b><i>Animation of a Cilium</i></b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Cilia are hairlike organelles on the 
		surfaces of many animal and lower plant cells that serve to move fluid 
		over the cell's surface or to &quot;row&quot; single cells through a fluid. In 
		humans, for example, epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract each 
		have about 200 cilia that beat in synchrony to sweep mucus towards the 
		throat for elimination. A cilium consists of a membrane-coated bundle of 
		fibers called an axoneme. An axoneme contains a ring of 9 double 
		microtubules surrounding two central single microtubules. Each outer 
		doublet consists of a ring of 13 filaments (subfiber A) fused to an 
		assembly of 10 filaments (subfiber B). The filaments of the microtubules 
		are composed of two proteins called alpha and beta tubulin. The 11 
		microtubules forming an axoneme are held together by three types of 
		connectors: subfibers A are joined to the central microtubules by radial 
		spokes; adjacent outer doublets are joined by linkers that consist of a 
		highly elastic protein called nexin; and the central microtubules are 
		joined by a connecting bridge. Finally, every subfiber A bears two arms, 
		an inner arm and an outer arm, both containing the protein dynein.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">But how does a cilium work? Experiments 
		have indicated that ciliary motion results from the chemically-powered 
		&quot;walking&quot; of the dynein arms on one microtubule up the neighboring 
		subfiber B of a second microtubule so that the two microtubules slide 
		past each other. However, the protein cross-links between microtubules 
		in an intact cilium prevent neighboring microtubules from sliding past 
		each other by more than a short distance. These cross-links, therefore, 
		convert the dynein-induced sliding motion to a bending motion of the 
		entire axoneme.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma">
		<img height="212" src="images/behefig2.gif" width="402" align="bottom" border="1" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></font></p>
		<p><i><b><font face="Tahoma" size="-1">Schematic drawing of part of a 
		cilium. The power stroke of the motor protein, dynein, attached to one 
		microtubule, against subfiber B of a neighboring microtubule causes the 
		fibers to slide past each other. The flexible linker protein, nexin, 
		converts the sliding motion to a bending motion.</font></b></i></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Now, let us sit back, review the 
		workings of the cilium, and consider what it implies. Cilia are composed 
		of at least a half dozen proteins: alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, dynein, 
		nexin, spoke protein, and a central bridge protein. These combine to 
		perform one task, ciliary motion, and all of these proteins must be 
		present for the cilium to function. If the tubulins are absent, then 
		there are no filaments to slide; if the dynein is missing, then the 
		cilium remains rigid and motionless; if nexin or the other connecting 
		proteins are missing, then the axoneme falls apart when the filaments 
		slide.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">What we see in the cilium, then, is not 
		just profound complexity, but also irreducible complexity on the 
		molecular scale. Recall that by &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; we mean an 
		apparatus that requires several distinct components for the whole to 
		work. My mousetrap <b>must</b> have a base, hammer, spring, catch, and 
		holding bar, all working together, in order to function. Similarly, the 
		cilium, as it is constituted, <b>must</b> have the sliding filaments, 
		connecting proteins, and motor proteins for function to occur. In the 
		absence of any one of those components, the apparatus is useless.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The components of cilia are single 
		molecules. This means that there are no more black boxes to invoke; the 
		complexity of the cilium is final, fundamental. And just as scientists, 
		when they began to learn the complexities of the cell, realized how 
		silly it was to think that life arose spontaneously in a single step or 
		a few steps from ocean mud, so too we now realize that the complex 
		cilium can not be reached in a single step or a few steps. But since the 
		complexity of the cilium is irreducible, then it can not have functional 
		precursors. Since the irreducibly complex cilium can not have functional 
		precursors it can not be produced by natural selection, which requires a 
		continuum of function to work. Natural selection is powerless when there 
		is no function to select. We can go further and say that, if the cilium 
		can not be produced by natural selection, then the cilium was designed.</font>

		<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The structure of a

		long, hairlike filament embedded in the cell membrane. The external 
		filament consists of a single type of protein, called &quot;flagellin.&quot; The 
		flagellin filament is the paddle surface that contacts the the liquid 
		during swimming. At the end of the flagellin filament near the surface 
		of the cell, there is a bulge in the thickness of the flagellum. It is 
		here that the filament attaches to the rotor drive. The attachment 
		material is comprised of something called &quot;hook protein.&quot; The filament 
		of a bacterial flagellum, unlike a cilium, contains no motor protein; if 
		it is broken off, the filament just floats stiffly in the water. 
		Therefore the motor that rotates the filament-propellor must be located 
		somewhere else. Experiments have demonstrated that it is located at the 
		base of the flagellum, where electron microscopy shows several ring 
		structures occur. The rotary nature of the flagellum has clear, 
		unavoidable consequences ... (Darwin's Black Box, p. 70-72)</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The consequences Behe refers to are

		concludes:</font></p>
		<p><i><font face="Tahoma" size="2">In summary, as biochemists have begun 
		to examine apparently simple structures like cilia and flagella, they 
		have discovered staggering complexity, with dozens or even hundreds of 
		precisely tailored parts. It is very likely that many of the parts we 
		have not considered here are required for any cilium to function in a 
		cell. As the number of equired parts increases, the difficulty of 
		gradually putting the system together skyrockets, and the likelihood of 
		indirect scenarios plummets. Darwin looks more and more forlorn. New 
		research on the roles of the auxiliary proteins cannot simplify the 
		irreducibly complex syetem The intransigence of the problem cannot be 
		alleviated; it will only get worse. Darwinian theory has given no 
		explanation for the cilium or flagellum. The overwhelming complexity of 
		the swimming systems push us to think it may never give an explanation.

		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">9. When a cut occurs, Tissue Factor 
		(which is only found outside of cells) is brought in near the wound 
		where it reacts with Convertin and Stuart Factor to produce Activated 
		Stuart Factor.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">10. Proaccelerin is activated by 
		Thrombin to produce Accelerin.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">11a. GLU-Prothrombin reacts with 
		Prothrombin Enzyme and Vitamin K to produce GLA-Prothrombin. (Note that 
		Prothrombin cannot be activated in the GLU form so it must be formed 
		into the GLA form. In this process ten amino acids must be changed from 
		glutamate to gama carboxy glutamate.)</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">11b. GLS-Prothrombin is then able to 
		bind to Calcium. This allows GLA-Prothrombin to stick to surfaces of 
		cells. Only intact modified Calcium-Prothrombin Complex can bind to the 
		cell membrane and be cleaved by Activated Stuart and Accerlerin to 
		produce Thrombin.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">12. Prothrombin-Ca (bound to cell 
		surface) is activated by Activated Stuart to produce Thrombin.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">13.Prothrombin also reacts with

		faster than step 12.)</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">14. Fibrinogin is activated by Thrombin

		the clot once the wound has healed. How is this done?</font></i></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">17a. A blood protein, Plasminogin is 
		activated by + - Pa to produce Plasmin. This acts like tiny chemical 
		scissors which cuts up the Fibrin filaments of the clot.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">17b. The rate at which the clot is 
		broken up is controlled by yet another blood protein named Alpha 2 
		Antiplasm, which in turn inactivates Plasmin. One of the most important 
		parts of this whole blood clotting machine is the ability it has to keep 
		the clotting localized to the area of the wound and to stop the clotting 
		cascade. Most heart attacks and strokes are caused by blood clots 
		lodging. You could say the blood-clot is the biggest killer of human 
		beings.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">18. Antithrombin inactivates Activated 
		Christmas, Activated Stuart and Thrombin.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">19. Protein C is activated by Thrombin 
		to produce Activated Protein C.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">20. Activated Protein C inactivates 
		Accelerin and Activated Antihemophilic.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">21. Finally, Thrombomodulin which lines 
		the inside of your blood vessels prevents Thrombin from activating 
		Fibrinogin. A logical question is : How do we know that we have to be 
		able to produce the whole set of enzymes or factors in the clotting 
		cascade in order to successfully accomplish the procedure?</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Probably the best answer is illustrated 
		by the disease hemophilia. Hemophilia A is the form of the disease that 
		85% of hemophiliacs have and it is caused by a deficiency of Stuart 
		Factor. The 14% that have hemophilia B are deficient in Accelerin. 
		People who have severe hemophilia A are able to produce 2-5% of normal 
		levels while another 15% are mild and are only able to make 5-30% of 
		normal levels of Stuart Factor output.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Like all enzymes, Stuart Factor is 
		produced by protein synthesis. Amino acids are joined together one at a 
		time by this orderly process. The gene for Stuart Factor contains 
		186,000 base pairs and occupies 0.1% of the X chromosome. Note that this 
		does not translate into Stuart Factor having 62,000 amino acids because 
		only the &quot;exon&quot; portions of the DNA molecule are expressed. The largest 
		portion of the DNA in this gene is found in the &quot;intron&quot; base pair 
		sequences. The gene for Accelerin contains 31,000 base pairs.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Why can a hemophiliac not stop bleeding? 
		They cannot stop because they either do not produce enough Stuart Factor 
		or they produce defective Stuart Factor. And why do they not produce the 
		right amount to type of Stuart Factor? The answer is, because their body 
		does not know how. Their parent passed on defective information on their 
		X chromosome, and incidentally, they will pass on the same defective 
		information on to their offspring.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">No one knows how this defective genetic 
		condition got started but it probably got started by a mutation or a 
		change in the DNA. Possibly a deletion, addition, or substitution at the 
		exact site where Stuart Factor protein must be cleaved to become 
		activated. In this case sufferers produce the normal amount of Stuart 
		Factor in their blood but it cannot be activated.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">What is the reasonable conclusion? It 
		seems like it is very important to have the proper amount and type of 
		Stuart Factor and I see no reason why we could logically conclude that 
		proper blood clotting would be performed without each step in the 
		clotting cascade.</font></p>
		<p><b><font face="Tahoma" size="4">Conclusion</font></b></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">What is the state of the art explanation 
		offered by evolutionists for the development of blood clotting? Russell 
		Doolittle is a professor of biochemistry at the Center for Molecular 
		Genetics at the University of California at San Diego. He is one of the 
		most prominent people who is interested in discovering how blood 
		clotting evolved. Professor Doolittle wrote an article in <em>Thrombosis 
		and Homeostasis</em> in which he attempted to answer the question, &quot;How 
		in the world did this complex and delicately balanced process evolve?&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">In his article, meant for other 
		professionals, Dr. Doolittle used the following phrases in his 
		explanation: <i>&quot;Tissue Factor appeared...&quot;, &quot;Prothrombin appears...&quot;, &quot;Fibrinogin 
		is born...&quot;, &quot;Antithrombin appears...&quot;, &quot;Plasminogin is generated...&quot;, &quot;Antiplasmin 
		arises...&quot;, &quot;TPA springs forth...&quot;. &quot;Proconvertin is duplicated from 
		Stuart Factor.&quot;</i> If you duplicate this sentence do you get anything 
		different?</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">&quot;Protein C is genetically derived from 
		Prothrombin.&quot; Unless Dr. Doolittle has Lamarkian evolution in mind, 
		proteins like Prothrombin cannot influence the animal's DNA to produce a 
		different enzyme known as Protein C. &quot;Prothrombin engages in an exchange 
		(of gene pieces).&quot; Prothrombin is a protein and as such it cannot 
		influence any specific &quot;gene exchange.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Michael Behe has the following 
		observations about Dr. Doolittle's explanation of clotting evolution:</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">&nbsp;<i>&quot;At no step--not even one--does Dr. 
		Doolittle give a model that includes numbers or quantities; without 
		numbers there is no science. When a merely verbal picture is painted of 
		the development of such a complex system there is absolutely no way to 
		know if it would actually work. When such crucial questions are ignored 
		we leave science and enter the world of Calvin and Hobbes&quot; (Darwin's 
		Black Box, p. 95).</i></font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Behe's major objection to the &quot;state of 
		the art&quot; evolutionary models is his concern for irreducible complexity. 
		Darwinian evolution is theorized to be directed by &quot;natural selection.&quot; 
		Natural selection only selects from the structures and biochemistry that 
		are present and cannot work on some kind of future structure.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The engine of Darwinian evolution only 
		works if there is something to select--something that is useful right 
		now, not in the future. Even if we accept his scenario for purposes of 
		discussion, however, by Doolittle's own account no blood clotting 
		appears until at least the third step.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">&nbsp;<i>&quot;The formation of tissue factor at 
		the first step is unexplained, since it would then be sitting with 
		nothing to do. In the next step (prothrombin popping up already endowed 
		with the ability to bind tissue factor, which somehow activates it) the 
		poor proto-prothrombin would also be twiddling its thumbs with nothing 
		to do until, at last, a hypothetical thrombin receptor appears at the 
		third step and fibrinogin falls from heaven at step four. Plasminogin 
		appears in one step, but its activator (TPA) does not appear until two 
		steps later. Stuart factor is introduced in one step and somehow tissue 
		factor decided that this is the complex it wants to bind. Virtually 
		every step of the suggested pathway faces similar problems&quot; (Darwin's 
		Black Box, p. 95).</i>&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">In order to have a controlled clotting 
		mechanism you have to have two proteins for each step. Both the pro 
		enzyme (non-activated) and its activator are required. Behe calculated 
		that the odds of getting factor TPA and its activator to be 1/10 to the 
		thirty-sixth power! To compound the problem, if &quot;...a protein appeared 
		in one step with nothing to do, then mutation and natural selection 
		would tend to eliminate it.&quot; To prevent this from happening, 
		evolutionists are forced to imagine large clusters of proteins evolving 
		all at once. This reminds one of Goldschmitt's hope monster in which a 
		reptile laid an egg and a bird hatched out.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Is it not much more satisfying to simply 
		believe that God created the whole mechanism fully functional and ready 
		to go? It does not go against reason to believe that intricate design, 
		especially when irreducible complexity is involved, demands an 
		intelligent Designer. On the other hand, it does go against reason to 
		&quot;believe&quot; that natural, pure chance changes in DNA (mutations) are 
		capable of producing a process that is so irreducibly complex such as 
		&quot;simple&quot; blood clotting.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Clearly, the irreducible complexity 
		inherent in many biochemical systems not only precludes the possibility 
		that they evolved by Darwinian natural selection, but actually suggests 
		the strong conclusion that intelligent design is necessary.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Yet the amazing complexity of these 
		systems has gone largely unnoticed and greatly unreported to the general 
		public. There is a great silence. Behe gives us a possible reason why, 
		he says:</font></p>
		<p><i><font face="Tahoma" size="2">&quot;<b>Why does the scientific community 
		not greedily embrace its startling discovery? Why is the observation of 
		design handled with intellectual gloves? The dilemma is that while one 
		side of the elephant is labeled intelligent design, the other side might 
		be labeled God.&quot; </b>(Darwin's Black Box, p.233).</font></i></td>

		<td><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Behe's sophisticated argument has 
		garnered the attention of many within the scientific community. His book 
		has been reviewed in the pages of Nature, Boston Review, Wall Street 
		Journal, and on many other sites on the Internet. While some have 
		genuinely engaged the ideas and offered serious rebuttal, most have sat 
		back on Darwinian authority and claimed that Behe is just lazy or hasn't 
		given the evolutionary establishment enough time. Jerry Coine in Nature 
		(19 september 1996, p.227-28) put it this way:</font> 
		<p><i><font face="Tahoma" size="2">&quot;There is no doubt that the pathways 
		described by Behe are dauntingly complex, and their evolution will be 
		hard to unravel. Unlike anatomical structures, the evolution of which 
		can be traced by fossils, biochemical evolution must be reconstructed 
		from highly evolved living organisms, and we may forever be unable to 
		envisage the first proto-pathways. It is not valid, however, to assume 
		that, because one man cannot imagine such pathways, they could not have 
		existed.&quot;</font></i></p>
		<p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Doesn't that rise the 
		question if it is valid to assume that there is no Designer, because 
		certain scientists cannot 'imagine such pathways' purely on hypothetical 
		grounds? </font></span><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">
		It would be fair and honest to review the macro-evolution theory in the 
		light of modern-day discoveries</font></span><O:P>.
		<font face="Tahoma" size="2">Irreducible complexity certainly stands out 
		as a large obstacle for evolution. The simplicity of the idea of design 
		has always disturbed scientists, claiming that this kind of 'simple 
		thinking' is not scientific. But how 'simple' would believing in design 
		be? The process of designing is intricate, fascinating and complex. Many 
		pro-design scientists are studying the same thing as their pro-evolution 
		colleagues. While the one group attributes this to a Designer, the other 
		group attributes it to a process called 'natural selection'. Let the 
		facts prove which explanation would be most justifiable.</font></p>
