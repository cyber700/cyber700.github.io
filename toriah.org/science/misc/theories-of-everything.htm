<h1><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;Theories of Everything</font></h1>
<hr>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An <a href="../articles/laughlin-2000.pdf">
article</a> by R.B. Laughlin (co-Nobel prize winner in 1998 for physics) and 
David Pines in PNAS discusses <i>theories of everything</i>.</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Theory of Everything is a term for the 
	ultimate theory of the universe—a set of equations capable of describing all 
	phenomena that have been observed, or that will ever be observed (1). It is 
	the modern incarnation of the reductionist ideal of the ancient Greeks, an 
	approach to the natural world that has been fabulously successful in 
	bettering the lot of mankind and continues in many people’s minds to be the 
	central paradigm of physics. A special case of this idea, and also a 
	beautiful instance of it, is the equation of conventional nonrelativistic 
	quantum mechanics, which describes the everyday world of human beings—air, 
	water, rocks, fire, people, and so forth.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, these equations cannot be accurately 
solved for a number of particles that exceed about 10. </font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Predicting protein functionality or the 
	behavior of the human brain from these equations is patently absurd. So the 
	triumph of the reductionism of the Greeks is a pyrrhic victory: We have 
	succeeded in reducing all of ordinary physical behavior to a simple, correct 
	Theory of Everything only to discover that it has revealed exactly nothing 
	about many things of great importance.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Laughlin writes on his
<a href="http://large.stanford.edu/rbl/lectures/somatter/p2.htm">website</a> (<a href="http://large.stanford.edu/rbl/lectures/index.htm">lecture</a>):</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We like to think that the fundamental basis 
	of all things is a set of equations describing the way the most basic 
	particles of nature move - quantum mechanically, of course. We like to joke 
	about these equations as the &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; because they would be 
	able to describe all things in the universe if we could solve them. But one 
	can see from this list of &quot;things&quot; that the whole idea is absurd. The 
	equations on the left are, to the best of our knowledge, the &quot;theory of 
	everything&quot; for people-scale phenomena, but they are much too hard to solve 
	even for a large molecule like DNA, much less a fish or a person. The real 
	reason we understand these more complicated things is because we observe 
	them and know from our observations that they obey rules. These rules are 
	not deduced from the &quot;theory of everything&quot;, although we believe they would 
	if the equations were ever solved properly. Unfortunately, the latter cannot 
	be tested because the problem is bigger than any computer that now exists, 
	or even any computer that can ever be built.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	Thus I have come to the point I wanted to make in this lecture. Human beings 
	understand and control the world they live in not because they have mastered 
	the ultimate causes of things but because <b>nature kindly organizes itself</b> 
	according to principles, and in this way allows us to understand. Indeed, 
	every physical quantity known to great accuracy owes this accuracy to a 
	collective principle we have identified and named. <b>Our search for the 
	ultimate causes is actually a myth, as are the allegations that this search 
	has been successfully concluded,</b> so that science is at an end.<br>
	<br>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In an <a href="../articles/laughlin-2004.pdf">
article</a> in Science (2004) Laughlin writes:</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In discussing cosmic matters it is 
	impossible not to draw analogies with science fiction art from time to time, 
	for the issues are as large as those depicted in such films and equally 
	mysterious, despite being experimentally constrained. <b>Our knowledge of 
	the cosmos is still very primitive, and much of our thinking about it 
	correspondingly speculative, more along the lines of what might plausibly 
	have been than what is so</b>. Plausibility is an interesting concept in 
	theoretical physics, usually amounting to either a physical analogy with 
	something observed to occur elsewhere in nature or a mathematical 
	extrapolation of microscopic law. The latter, however, is actually a 
	shibboleth, for the things that matter are nearly always collective 
	organizational phenomena that cannot be reliably predicted from microscopics. 
	The shapes of galaxies and the behavior of cosmic jets are simple cases in 
	point, but the observation also applies to the grandest issues of modern 
	cosmology, inflationary expansion and the hierarchical consolidation of 
	matter after the big bang [2-4]. The absence of predictive power is actually 
	self-evident, since there would be no point in measuring these things if one 
	could calculate them. As a practical matter, all plausibility arguments that 
	count are analogies.<br>
