<p>A post from avodah</p>
<hr>
<p>&gt; On Behalf Of Shinnar, Meir<br>
&gt; Sent: December 20, 2004 4:22 PM<br>
&gt; To: Avodah - High Level Torah Discussion Group<br>
&gt; Subject: RE: Torah and Science (a challenge) I agree that trying to <br>
&gt; construct one's theology on the basis of the big bang is problematic, <br>
&gt; because it might be abandoned<br>
<br>
Yes, agreed. <br>
<br>
&gt; - and the figure of 14<br>
&gt; billion years is not one that is hard and fast - but whatever number <br>
&gt; it is, it is more than 6000 years.<br>
<br>
What evidence do you have for this assertion that does not depend on 
assumptions, interpolations, extrapolations, deep theory and that is not plagued 
by stubborn anomalies?<br>
<br>
The last time the age of the universe had to be changed it had to be resolved 
*downwards* by an infinite decrement from t=-\infinity to t = 14GY.<br>
<br>
In a recent discussion on Avodah there was a (so far failed) attempt to use 
SN1987A as a proof that the universe is older than 168,000 years. This attempt 
has so far failed because it is undermined once you subject it to the 
Credibility Ladder.<br>
<br>
&gt; Similarly to evolution. ...<br>
&gt; while there are still fundamental issues about the mechanisms and <br>
&gt; dynamics of evolution, the fundamental theses of evolution have been <br>
&gt; settled by scientific criteria:1<br>
<br>
Scientific criteria or wishful thinking (see below)?<br>
<br>
&gt; 1) There is a temporal order to the appearance of different phylae, <br>
&gt; subphylae, order,etc<br>
&gt; 2) There are changes in species that have been documented over time<br>
&gt; 3) Phylae/subphylae that appear later seem to have relationships to <br>
&gt; phylae/subphylae that appeared earlier.<br>
&gt; part 1 that is crucial to our discussions -because the temporal order <br>
&gt; involved involves time scales related to the first question - far <br>
&gt; larger than 6000 years.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ad khan&quot; the propaganda. Now for the evidence. In fact, where is the evidence 
for common descent that does not depend on assumptions, interpolations, 
extrapolations, deep theory and that is not plagued by stubborn anomalies, or 
frauds such as Haeckel's embryos (see earlier post) that Darwin considered the 
most powerful evidence for common descent. Let us consider your first point, 
viz. the origin of phyla:<br>
<br>
---<br>
[Oxford University Professor, Richard Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker, 1986, pp. 
229-230] &quot;Before we come to the sort of sudden bursts that they [Eldredge and 
Gould] had in mind, there are some conceivable meanings of `sudden bursts' that 
they most definitely did not have in mind. These must be cleared out of the way 
because they have been the subject of serious misunderstandings.<br>
Eldredge and Gould certainly would agree that some very important gaps really 
are due to imperfections in the fossil record. Very big gaps, too.<br>
For example the Cambrian strata of rocks, vintage about 600 million years, are 
the oldest ones in which we find most of the major invertebrate groups.<br>
AND WE FIND MANY OF THEM ALREADY IN AN ADVANCED STATE OF EVOLUTION, THE VERY 
FIRST TIME THEY APPEAR. IT IS AS THOUGH THEY WERE JUST PLANTED THERE, WITHOUT 
ANY EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY. Needless to say, this appearance of sudden planting 
has delighted creationists. Evolutionists of all stripes believe, however, that 
this really does represent a very large gap in the fossil record, a gap that is 
simply due to the fact that, for some reason, very few fossils have lasted from 
periods before about 600 million years ago. One good reason might be that many 
of these animals had only soft parts to their<br>
bodies: no shells or bones to fossilize. IF YOU ARE A CREATIONIST YOU MAY THINK 
THAT THIS IS SPECIAL PLEADING. My point here is that, when we are talking about 
gaps of this magnitude, there is no difference whatever in the interpretations 
of `punctuationists' and `gradualists'. BOTH SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT DESPISE 
SO-CALLED SCIENTIFIC CREATIONISTS EQUALLY, AND BOTH AGREE THAT THE MAJOR GAPS 
ARE REAL, THAT THEY ARE TRUE IMPERFECTIONS IN THE FOSSIL RECORD. BOTH SCHOOLS OF 
THOUGHT AGREE THAT THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF 
SO MANY COMPLEX ANIMAL TYPES IN THE CAMBRIAN ERA IS DIVINE CREATION, AND BOTH 
WOULD REJECT THIS ALTERNATIVE.&quot;<br>
---<br>
<br>
This is a most amazing statement that deserves much further study. Dawkins is 
forced to resort to some very special pleading for the so called &quot;fact&quot;<br>
of common descent to justify a billion years of large scale macro-evolution from 
an amoeba (how did the original replicator start?) via (gorilla-like) hominids 
to man (where does language come from, what about altruism, and how to explain 
the deep problem of consciousness?). The pleading is very special, indeed, for 
body parts of ancient organisms have been discovered elsewhere in the fossil 
record.<br>
<br>
In fact, does the evidence suggest common descent as RMS suggests -- Dawkins 
states that we find the fossils &quot;already in an advanced state of evolution, the 
very first time they appear. It is as though they were just planted there, 
without any evolutionary history&quot;.<br>
<br>
What is interesting to me is that all of Darwin's most important categories of 
proof for common descent have either been discarded (like the fraud of Haeckel's 
embryos) or have major &quot;pirchas&quot; on them.<br>
<br>
&gt; How exactly the later species arose from the earlier ones is a matter <br>
&gt; of some debate - but that they arose is not.<br>
<br>
RMS is attempting, hereby, to distinguish between the so called &quot;fact&quot; of 
evolution (common descent with modification) and its mechanism (natural 
selection). However, Darwin himself wrote that without a mechanism there is no 
proof for common descent -- the one time the man actually made a telling point.<br>
<br>
Of course, there is not the faintest evidence for *any* naturalistic mechanism 
that can, through unintelligent natural causes, produce new complex organs:<br>
<br>
---<br>
[Harold, Franklin. M. The Way of the Cell: Molecules, Organisms, and the Order 
of Life. Oxford University Press, Oxford; New York, 2001, page 205] &quot;We should 
reject, as a matter of principle, the substitution of intelligent design for the 
dialogue of chance and necessity (Behe 1996); BUT WE MUST CONCEDE THAT THERE ARE 
PRESENTLY NO DETAILED DARWINIAN ACCOUNTS OF THE EVOLUTION OF ANY BIOCHEMICAL 
SYSTEM, ONLY A VARIETY OF WISHFUL SPECULATIONS.&quot; [James Shapiro, Stuart 
Kauffman, and Lynn Margulis have, in effect, conceded this point as well.]<br>
---<br>
<br>
What an astonishing admission for a theory that has dominated biology for over a 
hundred years. There is no good evidence for the mechanism (natural<br>
selection) and there is no good evidence for common descent. Only &quot;just so&quot;<br>
stories (&quot;wishful speculations&quot; says Franklin Harold) that do not even make it 
to the first step of the Credibility Ladder the &quot;sina qua non&quot; of any scientific 
theory (viz. repeatable observable experimental observation). <br>
<br>
Yet Harold and Dawkins say that there is some kind of a principle that forbids 
us from invoking the plan and purpose of the Creator (Franklin states that &quot;We 
should reject, as a matter of principle, the substitution of intelligent design 
for the [unintelligent] dialogue of chance and necessity&quot;). There is a 
principal, of course, and it is called -- methodological naturalism -- and it 
has to be adopted, despite all the evidence, to avoid the discomfort of a 
creation and design inference. To reproduce the quote of an earlier post:<br>
<br>
---<br>
[Dr. Richard Lewontin is the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard 
University, NYRoB, 1997] &quot;Our willingness to accept scientific claims that are 
against common sense is the key to an understanding of the real struggle between 
science and the supernatural. WE TAKE THE SIDE OF SCIENCE IN SPITE OF THE PATENT 
ABSURDITY OF SOME OF ITS CONSTRUCTS, IN SPITE OF ITS FAILURE TO FULFILL MANY OF 
ITS EXTRAVAGANT PROMISES OF HEALTH AND LIFE, IN SPITE OF THE TOLERANCE OF THE 
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY FOR UNSUBSTANTIATED JUST-SO STORIES, BECAUSE WE HAVE A 
PRIOR COMMITMENT, A COM-MITMENT TO MATERIALISM. It is not that the methods and 
institutions of science somehow com-pel us to accept a material explanation of 
the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori 
adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set 
of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, 
no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is 
absolute, for we can-not allow a Divine Foot in the door. The eminent Kant 
scholar Lewis Beck used to say that anyone who could believe in God could 
believe in anything. To appeal to an omnipotent deity is to allow that at any 
moment the regularities of nature may be ruptured, that miracles may happen.&quot;<br>
---<br>
<br>
It strikes me as ironic that some chashuva Yidden are so beguiled by this theory 
on the basis of so little evidence (to the extent that they distort our mesorah 
of a recent purposeful creation by the Borei Olam) in order to shoe-horn in a 
&quot;just so&quot; story consisting of &quot;unsubstantiated wishful speculations&quot; [Lewontin] 
whose key point is that man is an accident? What happened to our absolute 
conviction of the &quot;gadlus haadam&quot;?<br>
<br>
The theory of common descent with modification via natural selection (a true 
descendant of the Epicurean philosophy) has wreaked moral havoc to society 
whether in the form of casual abortion, euthanasia, and the destruction of 
marriage and societal values. Michael Tooley (PhD Princeton University 1968) 
currently Professor of Philosophy at the University of Colorado has 
unapologetically argued that you should be able to kill live healthy 
already-born human infants up to about the age of three months before their 
capacities exceed those of animals. Johnson has argued that Steven Pinker 
probably agrees with the logic but does not advance it because he believes that 
his readers are not ready for the Darwinian bottom line -- *yet*.<br>
<br>
---<br>
[Weikart, R. From Darwin to Hitler: Evolutionary Ethics, Eugenics, and Racism in 
Germany. Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2004. Dustjacket blurb] In this 
compelling and painstakingly researched work of intellectual history, Richard 
Weikart explains the revolutionary impact Darwinism had on ethics and morality. 
He demonstrates that many leading Darwinian biologists and social thinkers in 
Germany believed that Darwinism overturned traditional Judeo-Christian and 
Enlightenment ethics, especially those pertaining to the sacredness of human 
life. Many of these thinkers supported moral relativism, yet simultaneously 
exalted evolutionary &quot;fitness&quot;<br>
(especially in terms of intelligence and health) as the highest arbiter of 
morality. Weikart concludes that Darwinism played a key role not only in the 
rise of eugenics, but also in euthanasia, infanticide, abortion, and racial 
extermination, all ultimately embraced by the Nazis. He convincingly makes the 
disturbing argument that Hitler built his view of ethics on Darwinian principles 
rather than nihilistic ones. From Darwin to Hitler is a provocative yet balanced 
work that should encourage a rethinking of the historical impact that Darwinism 
had on the course of events in the twentieth century.<br>
---<br>
<br>
Dembski recently discussed the inability of evolution to account for altruism, 
and the kindness we display toward others at a cost to ourselves [witness the 
recent contributions and efforts for the victims of the tsunami]. He quotes 
philosopher of science Michael Ruse and Harvard biologist E. O. Wilson as 
stating that:<br>
---<br>
&quot;The time has come to take seriously the fact that we humans are modified 
monkeys, not the favored Creation of a Benevolent God on the Sixth Day. In 
particular, we must recognize our biological past in trying to understand our 
interactions with others. We must think again especially about our so-called 
&quot;ethical principles.&quot; The question is not whether biology -- specifically, our 
evolution -- is connected with ethics, but how. As evolutionists, we see that no 
[ethical] justification of the traditional kind is possible. Morality, or more 
strictly our belief in morality, is merely an adaptation put in place to further 
our reproductive ends. Hence the basis of ethics does not lie in God's will.... 
In an important sense, ethics as we understand it is an illusion fobbed off on 
us by our genes to get us to cooperate. It is without external grounding. Like 
Macbeth's dagger, it serves a powerful purpose without existing in substance. 
Ethics is illusory inasmuch as it persuades us that it has an objective 
reference.<br>
This is the crux of the biological position. Once it is grasped, everything 
falls into place.&quot;<br>
---<br>
<br>
The statement, above, is made not by radical atheistic evolutionists like 
Tooley, Pinker and Dawkins. It is a statement that probably characterizes the 
vast majority of leading scientists (see earlier post for the<br>
statistics) and it follows quite naturally and logically from the theory of 
evolution. It should be of serious concern to all bnei Torah to be &quot;docheh&quot;<br>
such false and dangerous &quot;shitos beshtei yaadaim&quot; and to embrace our authentic 
mesora of the purposeful creation of mankind &quot;betzelem Elokim&quot;.<br>
<br>
Once we free ourselves from the &quot;illusion fobbed off on us&quot; by materialists, our 
eyes will be opened to the wonders (and, yes, power) of creation. We will find 
tremendous joy, wonder and awe at everything we see with the Darwinian blinders 
removed. Consider these blinders as spoiling our fun.<br>
<br>
---<br>
An aside -- Shaar Habechina:<br>
<br>
As described in the JO eulogy, Rabbi Avigdor Miller zt&quot;l constantly taught us to 
be thankful for every aspect of life. When it rained, he would encourage people 
to thank Hashem for the bountiful fruits and vegetables which were, in 
potential, pouring down from the heavens. He would explain the beauty in 
countless creations of Hashem, pointing out how their very shape, color, or size 
was uniquely suited to the purpose of the creation.<br>
&quot;If we truly think, Hashem's wisdom can be seen everywhere. Simply study the 
apple, the peach, your eye, your hand, and you will surely find a wisdom that 
can only be Hashem's. For this we must give thanks; that is what life is all 
about.&quot; He would point out that rather than create a world of black and white, 
Hakadosh Baruch Hu filled the world with color and beauty to make it more 
attractive and pleasurable for people.<br>
<br>
Did we ever realize before that many fruits - apples, oranges, bananas, plums, 
peaches, grapes and cherries are green before they ripen, and that they blend in 
perfectly with the leaves of their trees? Maybe that's so that no one will 
notice them and pick them until they're ready. [It was not, and could not be, by 
accident].<br>
<br>
Did we look at the perfectly packaged, air-tight covering on the apple that 
seals out bugs and locks in the juices? Maybe that's so it will be fresh and 
flavorful until we are ready to eat it.<br>
<br>
Did we appreciate that if we bought too many and didn't finish them all in time, 
this same packaging turns an ugly brown color to let me know that the apple has 
overstayed its welcome? Did the food package in the supermarket turn brown to 
warn us that the food inside was off?<br>
<br>
Did we ever take advantage of the free coupons inside the apple that entitle us 
to a lifetime supply of apples? All we have to do is plant them!<br>
<br>
Did we fully understand that within these seeds is the formula to recreate a 
tree of wood, complete with roots and bark and leaves and blossoms that are 
capable of producing exact replicas of this tasty fruit, needing no food and 
nourishment other than water, sunlight and tasteless soil?<br>
<br>
Are we aware that somehow the tree knows how to signal the fruit stem to 
automatically detach itself from the branch and allow the fruit to gently fall 
to the ground (or on my head) as soon as the fruit is ripe?<br>
<br>
100 &quot;berochos&quot; a day were &quot;kovea&quot; by Anshei Knesses Hagedola to open us up the 
wonder of all we see. What a wonderful thought -- Hashem loves us and cares for 
us. What a responsibility.<br>
