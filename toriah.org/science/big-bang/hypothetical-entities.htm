On May 17th, 2004, Alan Guth of MIT made a presentation at ICCS'04. His slides
from the presentation state that &#8220;<a href="iccs-guth.pdf" target="_blank">We
have never had a model of the universe that works so well</a>&#8221; (p17),
referring to the current inflationary hot big bang model<a style='mso-footnote-id:

<br>
As a major piece of evidence for his claim, Guth states that &#8220;Latest

<br>
This sounds impressive!</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&#8220;&#937;&#8221; is the Greek
letter Omega which stands for the density of the universe. The density of the
universe means the amount of matter there is per unit volume, averaged for the
entire universe. The critical density corresponds to approximately one hydrogen
atom per cubic meter, a density that is more than ten million times lower than
that of the best vacuum that can be achieved in an earthbound laboratory.<a

Confused? Of course! At least I am. As a layman, I usually rely on the experts.
But if the experts argue or omit relevant data and assumptions in their

that contradict our <i>mesora</i>. <br>
<br>
Here is my understanding of what the dissident scientists object to and what
Alan Guth omitted to make clear in his slides, viz. the proliferation of
hypothetical entities which were introduced without much physical justification
to address contradictions with observations that would otherwise have led to

1. The big bang flatness and horizon problems in the standard model (involving
a contradiction between theory and observation) forced Guth and other
cosmologists to <i>postulate</i> inflation over twenty years ago. <br>
<br>
2. In all that time inflation has never been experimentally confirmed &#8211;
nobody has ever observed an <i>inflaton</i>!<br>
<br>
3. With the hypothetical inflation, the model predicts <i>Omega</i> = 1.0. <br>
<br>
4. This means that there has to be vast amounts of matter in the universe --
but current observed and predicted values are an order of magnitude less (about
5% of the predicted amount). <br>
<br>
5. To solve this problem cosmologists <i>hypothesize</i> that there is some
missing matter called &#8220;dark matter&#8221;. This missing and unobservable

the extra mass would slow the expansion of the universe. <br>

which could not be checked by other observations [see reference 43 in the
original]. Fitting a body of data with an arbitrarily large number of free

Significantly, even with seven freely adjustable parameters, the model greatly
overestimated the anisotropy on the largest angular scales. In addition, the

II. FUNDAMENTAL METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS OF THE BIG BANG <br>
<br>
The Big Bang theory requires three hypothetical entities-the inflation field,
nonbaryonic (dark) matter, and the dark energy field-to overcome gross
contradictions between theory and observation. Yet no evidence has ever
confirmed the existence of any of these three hypothetical entities. <br>
<br>
In each of these cases, the hypothetical entities were introduced without any
physical justification purely to address contradictions with observations that
would have otherwise led to the rejection of the Big Bang theory. The inflation
field, which causes a super-rapid expansion of the early universe, was
introduced after it was realized that the &quot;horizon problem&quot; prevented
parts of the universe that are currently more than a few degrees apart on the
sky from coming to the same equilibrium temperature, and thus producing the
same temperature background radiation, as observed. Without this field, the Big
Bang does not predict an isotropic CBR. <br>
<br>
But the inflation hypothesis predicted a matter-energy density for the universe
equal to the critical closure density, \Omega = 1.0. Unfortunately, Big Bang
nucleosynthesis predictions of the abundance of ordinary baryonic matter
predicts [approximately] \Omega &lt; .05, a gross self-contradiction. The idea
of nonbaryonic (dark) matter was introduced to overcome this contradiction. By
this hypothesis, 95% of the matter in the universe did not participate in the
reactions that formed the light elements. <br>
<br>
However, such a large amount of matter would cause a marked deceleration of the
expansion of the universe and led to predictions that the age of the universe
was less than 10 GY, considerably less that the age of the oldest globular
clusters in the Milky Way. To overcome this problem, as well as growing
evidence that there could not be anywhere near this much gravitating matter,
cosmologists introduced the cosmological constant and the corresponding dark
energy field, which would account for 70% of the matter-energy in the universe,
accelerate expansion, and increase the predicted age of the universe to 14 GY. <br>
In no other field of physics would the introduction of three hypothetical
entities, each unconfirmed by experimental evidence, be allowed to save a
theory. In addition, the hypothetical dark energy field violates one of the
best-tested laws of physics-the conservation of energy and matter-since the
field produces energy at a titanic rate out of nothingness. No evidence has
ever indicated the existence of nonbaryonic matter. Indeed, there have been
many lab experiments over the past 23 years that have searched for nonbaryonic
matter, all with negative results [15]. Continued discovery of more ordinary
matter in the form of white dwarfs [16] and diffuse plasma clouds [17] has
further decreased the ability of theorists to claim that there is far more
matter detected by gravitational attraction than can be accounted for by
ordinary matter. <br>
<br>
Moreover, the Big Bang theory relies fundamentally on the violation of another
very well-confirmed conservation law-conservation of baryon number. This law
dictates that baryons and antibaryons are always produced from energy in equal
numbers, and has been confirmed up to Tev energies. Yet an equal mixture of
baryons and antibaryons at high density as in the Big Bang would result in an extremely
dilute universe [1], so the Big Bang requires baryon nonconservation, in
conflict with all existing observations. Such baryon nonconservation also
implies a finite lifetime for the proton, a prediction also contradicted by
extensive experiments unsuccessfully seeking proton decay. <br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
VI. WHY IS THE BIG BANG STILL DOMINANT? <br>
<br>
All the basic predictions of the Big Bang theory have been repeatedly refuted
by observation. The plasma cosmology approach has been supported by thousands
of times less resources than has the Big Bang, but it has presented alternative
explanations for many of the basic phenomena of the universe, has predicted new
phenomena, and has not been contradicted by any evidence. Yet the Big Bang
remains by far the domain cosmological model. It is appropriate to ask why this
is so. <br>
<br>
Even the most blunt contradictions of theory and observation are viewed by Big
Bang advocates as, at most, the indications of &quot;new physics,&quot; never a
refutation of the theory. For example, Peebles, in considering the void
phenomenon, admits that there is an &quot;apparent inconsistency between theory
and observation,&quot; but does not conclude that theory is in any way
imperiled [48], rather only that an &quot;adjustment of the model&quot; may be
necessary. Similarly, Cyburt et al. [15] agree that there are &quot;clear
contradictions&quot; between BBN predictions and light element abundances, but
conclude that &quot;systematic uncertainties have been underestimated,&quot;
not that the theory is wrong. Consistently new observations have led to new parameters,
such as dark matter and dark energy, so that the number of adjustable
parameters in cosmological theories has increased exponentially with time,
approximately doubling each decade. <br>
<br>
Four hundred years ago, a similar situation existed, at least in Catholic
countries. Sixty years after the formulation of Copernican hypothesis, the
Ptolemaic view of the solar system remained the dominant one among Continental
astronomers. Galileo's elegant comparison of the Copernican and Ptolemaic
systems, his Dialog on Two World Systems, should have ended any scientific
doubt as to the validity of the Copernican approach. Yet many additional
decades would pass before the Copernican system, already accepted at that time
in <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>, would be
accepted in the Catholic areas of <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>. <br>
<br>
There is no mystery as to why this was so in the 16th century. The Ptolemaic
theory was a state-supported scientific theory. The Catholic Church's advocacy
of this theory would not have much mattered if the Catholic states had not given
the Church the power to enforce, with state backing, its ideological edicts.
Galileo, for his pro-Copernican writing, was subject to a civil penalty-house
arrest-and famously forced to recant under threat of far worse penalties. <br>
<br>
Today, the situation is similar, although the penalties for dissent are milder:
loss of funding rather than loss of liberty or life. The Big Bang survives not
because of its scientific merits, but overwhelmingly because it has effectively
become a state supported theory. Funds for astronomical research and time on
astronomical satellites are allocated almost exclusively by various
governmental bodies, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National
Aeronautics and Space Administration <br>
(NASA) in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The review committees that allocate these funds are controlled tightly by
advocates of the Big Bang theory who refuse to fund anything that calls their
work into question. It is no secret that, today, no one who pursues research
that questions the Big Bang, who develops alternatives to the Big Bang, or, for
the most part, who even investigates evidence that contradicts the Big Bang,
will receive funding. As a result, with very few exceptions, those who want to
make a career in cosmology are constrained to work within the Big Bang
framework-to do otherwise is to risk being cut off from funding, and, if a
junior researcher, from tenure. <br>
<br>
It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss how the Big Bang came to be
state-supported theory (see [49] for a more detailed treatment). However, as
long as such bias in the funding process continues, it will be extremely
difficult for cosmology to extricate itself from the dead-end of the Big Bang.</p>

<b>Subject:</b> no proof of dark matter<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
text-align:justify'><span style='color:black'>I&#8217;m responding to many
inquiries about the &#8220;proof of dark matter&#8221; papers, astro-ph0608407
and 0608408 by Clowe et al. and Bradac et al. Data in the second paper is
needed to understand fully the first one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
text-align:justify'><span style='color:black'>The first paper is very
inappropriately titled and does not at all prove what it claims--the existence
of dakr matter. The term &#8220;dark matter&#8221; is used in the scientific
literature, and in this paper, as a synonym for non-baryonic matter, matter
which is different from the ordinary matter observed anywhere on earth,
including in particle accelerators. This paper does nothing to prove the
existence of such matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
text-align:justify'><span style='color:black'>What this paper actually provides
evidence for is something very different: that in the case of this particular
pair of colliding clusters of galaxies, the greater part of the mass is
spatially associated with the galaxies and not with the hot intracluster gas.
This evidence is that gravitational-lensing measures of total mass outline the
concentrations of galaxies, which are physically separate from the main hot gas
concentrations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
text-align:justify'><span style='color:black'>How do Clowe et al get from what
was actually indicated to what they claimed? Only though a big <i>assumption</i>,
which is in no way supported by their data.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
text-align:justify'><span style='color:black'>The major assumption is that all
of the baryonic, ordinary, matter is in the form of hot plasma or bright stars
in galaxies.&nbsp; The paper shows that the total amount of gravitating matter,
as measured by gravitational lensing, does not correlate with the amount of hot
plasma, as measured by x-rays.&nbsp; Therefore, the authors argue, the
gravitating matter is instead associated with the galaxies. Since the
gravitating mass is much greater than the mass in easily-visible stars, and <i>by
assumption</i>, there is no other baryonic matter, the mass must be
non-baryonic or dark matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
text-align:justify'><span style='color:black'>The flaw in this argument is this
assumption that all the ordinary matter in galaxies is in easily-visible,
bright, stars. Instead, most of the mass of galaxies may well be in the form of
dwarf stars, which produce very little light per unit mass&#8212;in other words
have a very high mass-to-light ratio. Several studies of galaxies using very
long exposures have shown that they have &#8221;red halos&#8221;, halos of
stars that are mostly red dwarfs.&nbsp; Other studies have indicated that the
halos may be filled with white dwarfs, the dead remains of burnt-out stars. In
addition, there is evidence that a huge amount of mass may be tied up in
relatively cool clouds of plasma that do not radiate much x-ray radiation, and
would be in closer proximity to the galaxies than the hot plasma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
text-align:justify'><span style='color:black'>The Clowe paper in no way
contradict these possibilities, so in no way prove the existence of dark, or
non-baryonic matter. Instead, they <i>assume</i> that any mass associated with
the galaxies that is not in bright stars is non-baryonic, dark matter. They
assume what they seek to prove. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
text-align:justify'><span style='color:black'>Clowe et al also argues that
their results refute the idea that there could be a modified gravitational law
such as MOND. Yet if the measurements of gravitating mass are accurate, the
clusters are all in the non-MOND regime, where the gravitational acceleration
is more than 10^-8 cm/sec^2, so the clusters don&#8217;t provide a test of
MOND.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
text-align:justify'><span style='color:black'>In short, this paper really adds
almost nothing to the debate about dark matter. It was already well known that
hot plasma and bright stars in galaxies do not contain most of the mass in most
clusters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Wesley, 1997: 22. One way to find the average density would be to add up all
the matter in the universe and then divide by the number of cubic meters in the
universe. However, this process is difficult to accomplish. Theorists have

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-line-height-alt:8.0pt'><span style='font-size:
9.0pt'>Solving the equation for omega requires knowing four numbers, three of
which are currently not known with certainty. The only number that is known is
the velocity of light. No one yet knows the value for the deceleration
parameter or the cosmological constant and there are still disagreements over
the Hubble constant. The deceleration parameter measures the rate at which the
expansion is slowing down due to the gravitational attraction among all the
clusters of galaxies. The Hubble constant denotes the rate at which the
universe is expanding. The density of the universe affects the future of the
universe. If omega turns out to be more than <i>one</i> (i.e. there is more
than one hydrogen atom per cubic meter) then the universe will eventually stop
expanding and contract forming a &quot;closed&quot; universe, i.e. a universe
with finite volume and mass. If omega is less than <i>one</i> (i.e. there is
less than one hydrogen atom per cubic meter) the universe will expand forever
and will eventually thin out forming an &quot;open&quot; universe. According to
Einstein's theory, an &quot;open&quot; universe has an infinite volume and an
infinite number of hydrogen atoms. However, if omega equals one, the universe
is at the &quot;critical density.&quot; When the universe is at the critical
density, it means that the universe will expand at precisely the right rate to
avoid recollapse thus forming a &#8220;flat&#8221; universe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
