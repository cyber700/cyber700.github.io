<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dear ...<br>
<br>
Thank you for forwarding the comments below by a prominent physicist&nbsp; to my
<a href="big-bang.pdf">paper</a> (currently under revision) on big bang 
cosmology (BBC) and the age of the universe. I don't know who the physicist is 
but my response follows.<br>
<br>
<i>&gt; The big bang is no longer controversial, and with the recent (last 5<br>
&gt; years or so) discoveries of accelerated expansion, and the convergence<br>
&gt; of a wide spectrum of amazingly accurate and revealing cosmological<br>
&gt; measurements, many more details seem now to be settled. For example,<br>
&gt; it now seems clear that only about 5% of the matter/energy in the<br>
&gt; universe is the ordinary sort of matter that we see around us or that<br>
&gt; is in stars, 25% is cold dark matter of which nobody knows what it is<br>
&gt; (a known unknown) and the remaining 70% is something called dark<br>
&gt; energy, of which nobody has a clue what it is (an unknown<br>
&gt; unknown). But these numbers seem pretty solid.</i><br>
<br>
I realize that as a layman it appears ludicrous for me to argue with experts in 
the field. However, I have seen comments such as the above by other physicists 
in response to the paper and they no longer puzzle me as they did at first, and 
I would like to explain why they do not address the issues raised in the paper.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman">Responding to the six assumptions underlying 
big bang cosmology</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The first thing to note is that there is no 
admission that the issues I raised are cause for concern. For example I quoted 
Steven Weinberg who stated that the fundamental BBC assumption of the 
cosmological principal hangs like a &quot;dark cloud&quot; over the standard model because 
it is an untested yet fundamental assumption. So I would expect a tacit 
admission of the concerns raised followed by a &quot;but .... I can explain why these 
concerns can be answered&quot;. Or I would expect an analysis of why the concerns are 
not even concerns. Perhaps it can be shown that I got the facts wrong (entirely 
possible for a layman).<br>
<br>
So is Steven Weinberg's admission still correct today or not? If it is correct, 
why not admit to the concern?<br>
<br>
The same applies to the other issues raised in the paper (six of them in total).</font></p>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman">How do deeply held theories get debunked?</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Einstein and scientists of his time (prior to GR) 
deeply believed in an eternal static university. Yet BBC overthrew all of this 
with the age of the universe suddenly decreased from minus infinity to 13.7 
billion years (to Einstein's shock and that of most other physicists of his time 
such as Eddington who thought the very idea of a beginning was repulsive). <br>
<br>
We are trying to explain that fact -- how could these great scientists make such 
a major mistake? Again, perhaps the same mistake is repeated with BBC?</font></p>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman">Speculative vs. Empirical Science</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The thesis of my paper (which I owe to others 
including Maimonides in the second section of the <i>Guide</i>) is that we must 
not confuse <i>necessary</i> conditions with <i>sufficient</i> conditions! When 
you have checked out some necessary (but not yet sufficient) conditions your 
theory is still speculative especially where it is plagued by other concerns 
such as stubborn anomalies (see below). My contribution was to apply this to BBC 
in an attempt to tease apart the scientific <i>claims</i> from the <i>evidence</i> 
for the claims. <br>
<br>
For example, since the cosmological principle has not been verified in the lab., 
this means that it is a sheer assumption. Thus, it is vulnerable to being 
falsified. If so it would undermine BBC despite other points of evidence such as 
the discovery of the cosmic background radiation (CBR). The cosmological 
principle is a necessary condition and the CBR is a necessary condition for BBC, 
but even when taken together they are not sufficient to guarantee the truth of 
BBC as then other concerns I raised would have to be addressed. Since 
experimental evidence is the <i>sina qua non </i>of science I suggest we can 
distinguish when a theory is speculative vs. empirically proven using the 
following indicators (see p7 of my paper):</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">(a) To what extent have the foundational 
	assumptions checked out directly in the lab?</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">(b) What interpolations and extrapolations 
	have been made and to what extent the extrapolation is made (large backward 
	extrapolations being most suspect). A large extrapolation may be an educated 
	guess but it is nevertheless a guess!</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">(c) What stubborn anomalies plague the 
	theory?</font></li>
	<li><font face="Times New Roman">(d) What untested hypothetical entities are 
	postulated that have not been directly confirmed in the lab? (deep theory).</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Since BBC suffers from all of the above I 
consider it to be speculative and so it is (unless the facts that I present in 
my paper are wrong). The indicators (a) to (d) can thus be used to distinguish 
between <i>speculative</i> science and <i>empirical</i> science. (Technology 
such as the space age 
marvels such as getting to the moon and mapping the human genome are all based 
on empirically verified operational science, not the speculations made in 
cosmology and evolutionary biology).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The comments by the physicist agree that nobody 
has a clue about the postulated dark energy (or the missing dark matter) a force 
totally different in kind from any other force ever observed apart from the fact 
that nobody has ever directly observed it in the lab. It is a 
<a href="hypothetical-entities.htm">hypothetical 
entity </a>that is invented to explain observations that contradict the standard 
theory in the same way that the hypothetical planet Vulcan was (incorrectly) 
invented to explain the Mercury anomaly. <br>
<br>
The pre-BBC static eternal universe suffered from same vulnerabilities to 
experimental evidence as BBC and that is why I label both as speculative, and 
this explains why Einstein, Eddington and the rest were proven wrong. I have yet 
to see an alternative explanation for the failure of the deeply held eternal 
universe!<br>
<br>
The reason I am unsurprised that physicists appear unable to admit to this 
simple point (assuming I got my facts straight) is because their training is not 
in logic and epistemology. Scientists are (correctly) interested in an inference 
to the best explanation. Given two theories say <i>T1</i> and <i>T2</i> that 
both (approximately) explain the known facts, then if <i>T2</i> makes a 
prediction (say <i>P</i>) that <i>T1</i> cannot match then we accept <i>T2</i> 
as the new theory provided we later observe <i>P</i>. Now I realize that I am 
being over-simplistic here for the sake of brevity, but this does explain in 
part what I believe is a much used mode of reasoning (e.g. see Brian Greene's 
book &quot;The elegant universe&quot; p.210-211 on the difference between a <i>prediction</i> 
and a <i>postdiction</i>).<br>
<br>
Now all this is fine for science to make progress but it does not make BBC an 
empirically tested theory. I have no objection to this mode of reasoning 
provided speculations are clearly labelled as such and the proper distinction is 
made between a claim and the evidence for the claim. It should not be left to 
layman like myself to tease apart the <i>claims</i> and the <i>evidence</i> for 
the claims -- this should be done by scientists themselves who are in the best 
position to understand the complexities and subtleties of the issues. Again we 
should not confuse the confirmation of a necessary condition (such as <i>P</i> 
above) with that of the sufficient conditions needed to confirm the theory.<br>
<br>
Since I provided what I believe are 6 untested assumptions of BBC I would expect 
a proper rejoinder to address each of these issues (and there are more problems 
with BBC that I have not yet incorporated into the paper).<br>
<br>
This is why I say I am not puzzled but rather disappointed at the lack of 
response to the substantive issues raised</font></p>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman">Is big bang cosmology more compatible with 
creation?</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&gt; One thing that seems ironic about the piece 
is this: The big bang is<br>
&gt; often presented as the discovery of science most compatible with<br>
&gt; religion. In fact I recently heard that the resistance to the big<br>
&gt; bang, at first by Einstein and later by others, like Fred Hoyle, was<br>
&gt; due to their dislike for religion. However, I don't believe that.</i><br>
<br>
This is a good point -- BBC is superficially more compatible with creation when 
compared to a static universe. <br>
<br>
However, I hesitate to build anything substantial on speculations. Indeed many 
physicists now feel that they can explain the big bang without the need to 
appeal to creation (references available on request). The attempts I have seen 
to do so are also speculative. Attempts by some religious scientists to fit BBC 
with the first few chapters in Genesis have failed, quite badly, in my opinion. 
So, as far as I am concerned, both the uncreated universe and the big bang 
universe are interesting but equally speculative. Neither are able to provide a 
credible explanation for our vast cosmos of unbelievable complexity fine tuned 
for life and discovery.<br>
