	<div class="storycontent">
			<font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/uncommon-ground/archives/2005/05/natural_law_and.html">Uncommon Ground</a> has a brief note today titled &#8220;Natural Law and Intelligent Design,&#8221; in which the author plugs a longer piece by Matthew Yglesias titled &#8220;Nature and Super-Nature&#8221; (go <a href="http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew/2005/05/nature_and_supe.html">here</a>). This piece is rife with misconceptions about the nature of science and the status of methodological materialism as a normative rule for science.  Since these questions are very much at the forefront of current legal and educational battles, let me weigh in here. The key is to understand that the nature-supernature distinction poses a false dilemma. There is a third option. <a id="more-79"></a>
			</font>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yglesias tacitly assumes a normative principle for science known as methodological naturalism or methodological materialism. Moreover, for him ID’s rejection of this principle entails that ID must be committed to a form of supernaturalism. This, in turn, makes ID for him a religious belief.
	</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The impression Yglesias leaves is that whereas conventional evolutionary theory is engaged in the hard work of real science, intelligent design appeals to the supernatural and thus gives up on science, substituting magic for “natural explanations.” But what are “natural explanations”? Indeed, what constitutes nature remains very much an open question. If one reviews the ID literature, one finds that early on there were quite a few references to “the supernatural,” but that by 2000 (especially with <a href="http://www.designinference.com/documents/2000.04.nature_of_nature.htm">Baylor’s Nature of Nature conference</a>, which I helped organize), references to the supernatural largely disappear. The reason for this is that the very term “supernatural” concedes to materialists like Yglesias precisely the point at issue, namely, what is nature like and what are the causal powers by which nature operates.
	</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yglesias wants to say that nature operates only by natural causes and is explained scientifically only through natural explanations. But what does Yglesias mean by nature? In a previous blog entry at ID the Future (go <a href="http://www.idthefuture.com/index.php?title=is_intelligent_causation_perfectly_natur&#038;more=1&#038;c=1&#038;tb=1&#038;pb=1">here</a>), I briefly criticized methodological materialism. There I cited Eugenie Scott as follows:</font></p>
	<blockquote><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most scientists today require that science be carried out according to the rule of methodological materialism: to explain the natural world scientifically, scientists must restrict themselves only to material causes (to matter, energy, and their interaction). There is a practical reason for this restriction: it works. By continuing to seek natural explanations for how the world works, we have been able to find them. If supernatural explanations are allowed, they will discourage—or at least delay—the discovery of natural explanations, and we will understand less about the universe.  [For context go <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/6149_science_and_religion_chris_3_1_1998.asp ">here</a>.]</font></p></blockquote>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In response, I noted that</font></p>
	<blockquote><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are two problems with this [Eugenie Scott’s] statement. First, if methodological materialism is merely a working hypothesis that scientists employ because “it works,” then scientists are free to discard it when it no longer works. Design theorists contend that for adequately explaining biological complexity, methodological materialism fails and rightly needs to be discarded. Second, and more significantly, in defining science as the search for natural explanations, Scott presupposes precisely what must be demonstrated. If, by natural explanations, Scott simply means explanations that explain what is happening in nature, there would be no problem, and intelligent design would constitute a perfectly good natural explanation of biological complexity. But that is not what she means. 
		</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By natural explanations, Scott means explanations that resort only to material causes—as she puts it, to “matter, energy, and their interaction.” But that is precisely the point at issue, namely, whether nature operates exclusively by such causes. If nature contains a richer set of causes than purely material causes, then intelligent design is a live possibility and methodological materialism will misread physical reality. Note, also, that to contrast natural explanations with supernatural explanations further obscures this crucial point. Supernatural explanations typically denote explanations that invoke miracles and cannot be understood scientifically. But explanations that call upon intelligent causes require no miracles and give no evidence of being reducible to Scott’s trio of “matter, energy, and their interaction.” Indeed, design theorists argue that intelligent causation is perfectly natural provided that nature is understood aright. 
	</font> </p></blockquote>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because so much of this debate over intelligent design hinges on the nature of nature, I need to expand on these remarks. Nature, as conceived by Scott, Yglesias, and many other critics opposed to ID, consists of material entities ruled by fixed laws of interaction, often referred to as “natural laws.” These laws can be deterministic or nondeterministic, which is why some scientists refer to nature as being governed by “chance and necessity.” (Cf. Jacques Monod’s book by that title.) Obviously, these laws of interaction rule out any form of intelligent agency acting real-time within nature. They operate autonomously and automatically: given certain material entities with certain energetic properties in certain spatio-temporal relationships, these entities will behave in certain prescribed ways.
	</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An inescapable question now arises: How do we know that nature is in fact a set of material entities ruled by fixed laws of interaction? In particular, how do we know that everything that happens in nature can be accounted for in terms of antecedent material conditions and the processes that act on them characterized by these laws of interaction? Once the question is posed this way, it becomes an open question whether nature comprises a set of material entities ruled by fixed laws of interaction. In fact, it becomes a live possibility that nature, so conceived, is radically incomplete. In my book <em>No Free Lunch </em>I summarize what’s at issue here as follows:</font></p>
	<blockquote><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In arguing that naturalistic explanations are incomplete or, equivalently, that natural causes cannot account for all the features of the natural world, I am placing natural causes in contradistinction to intelligent causes. The scientific community has itself drawn this distinction in its use of these twin categories of causation. Thus, in the quote earlier by Francisco Ayala, “Darwin’s greatest accomplishment [was] to show that the directive organization of living beings can be explained as the result of a natural process, natural selection, without any need to resort to a Creator or other external agent.” Natural causes, as the scientific community understands them, are causes that operate according to deterministic and nondeterministic laws and that can be characterized in terms of chance, necessity, or their combination (cf. Jacques Monod’s Chance and Necessity). To be sure, if one is more liberal about what one means by natural causes and includes among natural causes telic processes that are not reducible to chance and necessity (as the ancient Stoics did by endowing nature with immanent teleology), then my claim that natural causes are incomplete dissolves. But that is not how the scientific community by and large understands natural causes. (pp. xiii-xiv)</font></p></blockquote>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The point to appreciate here is that Yglesias and his compadres, in assuming methodological materialism, have assumed precisely the point at issue. Specifically, to say, as Yglesias suggests, that science is the search for natural explanations of natural phenomena is to presuppose that such explanations exist for all natural phenomena. But how is this claim to be justified? Rather than justify it, Yglesias begs the question. To see that Yglesias has indeed made a question-begging assumption here, consider the following analogy drawn from the game of chess. In chess, there are initially thirty-two pieces arranged on an eight-by-eight chessboard as follows:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img src="http://www.uncommondescent.com/images/chess1.jpg" alt="chess1" /></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Moreover, chess operates by certain fixed rules. For instance, bishops move diagonally, pawns only move forward and only take one square diagonally, etc. In this analogy, the chess pieces in their initial configuration correspond to the material entities that for Yglesias constitute nature and the rules of chess correspond to the laws of interaction that for Yglesias govern nature.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Given the initial position of chess pieces and the rules of the game, we can ask whether the following position is possible:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img src="http://www.uncommondescent.com/images/chess2.jpg" alt="chess2" /></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It turns out that it is not. There is no way to get from the first position to the second by the rules of chess. 
	</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So too, intelligent design purports to show that there exist configurations of material entities (e.g., bacterial flagella, protein synthesis mechanisms, and complex organ systems) that cannot be adequately explained in terms of antecedent material conditions together with processes characterized by fixed laws that act on them. Granted, chess constitutes a toy example whereas the biological examples ID theorists investigate are far more complicated. Moreover, whereas chess operates according to precise mathematical rules, the laws of interaction associated with material entities are probabilistic, so the obstacles to producing complex biological configurations of material entities are not logical impossibilities but empirical improbabilities. But the point of the analogy still holds. Whenever you have a theory about process &#8212; how one state is supposed to progress into another &#8212; it is perfectly legitimate to ask whether the process in question is capable of accounting for the final state in terms of the initial state.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It follows that the charge of supernaturalism against intelligent design cannot be sustained. Indeed, to say that rejecting naturalism entails accepting supernaturalism holds only if nature is defined as a closed system of material entities ruled by unbroken laws of material interaction. But, as we have just seen, this begs the question. Consider the following riddle: If one calls a tail a leg, how many legs does a dog have? The correct answer is: Four &#8212; calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it a leg. 
	</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Likewise, defining nature as a closed system of material entities operating by fixed laws of interaction doesn’t make it so. Nature is what nature is, and prescribing methodological materialism as a normative principle for science (as so many critics of ID do) does nothing to change that. ID theorists argue that methodological materialism fundamentally distorts our understanding of nature. For the purposes of this case, the crucial thing is not whether they are right but whether they might be right. Given that they might be right, methodological materialism cannot be taken as a defining feature of science, much less should it be held dogmatically. To make methodological materialism a defining feature of science commits the premodern sin of forcing nature into a priori categories rather than allowing nature to speak for itself.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To sum up, Yglesias and company present us with a false dilemma: either science must be limited to “natural explanations” (taken in a highly tendentious sense) or it must embrace “supernatural explanations,” by which is meant magic. But there is a third possibility: <em>neither matter nor magic but mind</em>. ID theorists are not willing to concede the materialist claim that a designing intelligence (mind) interacting with matter is “supernatural.” Indeed, investigations by ID theorists are beginning to demonstrate that this interaction is perfectly natural &#8212; that nature cannot be properly understood apart from the activity of a designing intelligence.

		<font face="Verdana" size="2">ID pioneer Michael Polanyi had 2 Nobel Laureate pupils, one was Eugene Wigner (whom I consider a grandfather of ID), and the other his son John Polanyi.  It was through a &#8220;proof by contradiction&#8221; in quantum theory that Wigner introduced mind as an irreducible entity that influences nature.  Ironically, the origin-of-life researcher, Harold Morowitz, who testified against the creationists in the landmark McLean vs. Arkansas, had this to say, which is sympathetic to ID:</font><p>
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">&#8220;The views of a large number of contemporary physcal scientists are summed up in the essay &#8220;remarks on the Mind-Body Question&#8221; written by Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner. Wigner begins by pointing out that most physical scientists have returned to the recognition that thought&#8211;meaning the mind&#8211;is primary. he goes on to state: &#8220;It was not possible to formulate the laws of quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to the consciousness.&#8221; And he concludes by noting how remarkable it is that the scientific study of the world led to the content of consciousness as the ultimate reality.<br />
&#8230;.<br />
Third and last, atomic physics, which is now understood most fully by means of quantum mechanics, must be formulated with the mind as a primitive component of the system.<br />
&#8230;.<br />
What emerges from all this is the return of &#8220;mind&#8221; to all areas of scientific thought&#8230;<br />

		<font face="Verdana" size="2">I totally agree with you Bill.  Such reductive explanations as far as the universe and biology are highly equivocal.  It is only the naturalists who are ardently holding to some blind faith in material processes to account for everything we see.  The analogy of the chess board was good.  When you argue your case for ID,whether it&#8217;s at school, the court or elsewhere this analogy plus the previously mentioned naturalists will totally drive the point home.  It&#8217;s ironic how the scientific materialists blame the religionists for hampering the progress of science.  However, it looks like they are repeating the same atrocity.  For example, it took 25-30 years to accept the big bang theory.  In it&#8217;s inception, the materialists strived fervently to espouse an oscillating universe. Although untenable, they continued to push their case.  Simply because it made them uncomfortable.  Once again, we are seeing the same thing happening.  Only now in biology.  A place where teleology and design have been exile for about 150 years.  Do we honestly need the materialists to hamper the evidence again?  Beyond science it just becomes pure philosophy.  Case in point, Weinberg, Dawkins, Sagan, Gould, Lewontin and many more.

		<font face="Verdana" size="2">Good post.  There are two major criticisms of ID: 1) ID falls outside of science; 2) ID is not in peer-reviewed literature.  Perhaps there&#8217;s another: 3) There are no evolutionary biologists who doubt evolution. It&#8217;s good that you are tackling the first objection.  I recently read an interesting paper by a professor that I know that suggests that consciousness is the fundamental entity in the universe (as opposed to matter).  The professor suggested that the physical world is actually just a user interface that conscious agents use to interact with each other.  I don&#8217;t know if I would totally agree with that, but it is an interesting perspective.

		<font face="Verdana" size="2">Would anyone care to respond to the following talk.origins post arguing against Dembski&#8217;s chess analogy?</font><p>
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">&#8220;[Dembski] presents a chess board with the pieces in a configuration that<br />
cannot be achieved by the rules of chess. He then compares this to ID,<br />
suggesting that, like the board, biological complexity cannot be<br />
explained by the rules of natural processes. This leads to the<br />
inevitable conclusion that there was an intervention of something<br />
beyond the rules to achieve the configuration.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#8220;Granting for the moment (an extraordinarily large and extraordinarily<br />
unwarranted grant) that this chess configuration *is* analogous to<br />
biological complexity, it seems to me that Dembski misses the true<br />
value of this comparison as regards science.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#8220;What the chess configuration-biocomplexity is really offering is the<br />
chance to discover something new about how the natural world operates.<br />
Chess is a finite operational system, all the rules are known. No one,<br />
I hope even Dembski, would suggest that the same holds for biology.<br />
There are new things to be learned, new mechanisms to be uncovered. New<br />
rules to be understood. And Dembski&#8217;s unattainable chess board is<br />
perfectly analogous to that moment when a scientist looks at some data<br />
about the natural world and mutters, &#8220;hmmm&#8230;that&#8217;s not supposed to<br />
happen.&#8221; Of such configurations stimulating breakthoughs are made.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#8220;As often happens with Dembski&#8217;s arguments, he got it partly right, it<br />
just doesn&#8217;t mean what he thinks it means. That he believes this<br />
example shows why inference to the supernatural is warranted<br />
underscores not only how little he understands real science, but also<br />
how little he values it.&#8221;<br />

		<font face="Verdana" size="2">The issue is not whether we know all of the laws of nature. The issue is whether there are configurations of matter that are inaccessible from other configurations of matter via processes governed by those laws &#8212; whatever those laws happen to be. The story is told of former world chess champion Raoul Capablanca learning chess as a small boy watching grown-ups play the game. Clearly, he didn&#8217;t know all the rules from the start. But even so, there would have been no way to get from the first chess configuration that I gave to the second. This post on talk.origins confuses epistemology with ontology. Just because we don&#8217;t know all the laws does not mean that they are not fixed and don&#8217;t constrain what can happen. Moreover, just because we don&#8217;t know all the laws doesn&#8217;t mean that we can&#8217;t reliably do eliminative inductions and rule out certain possibilities on the basis of those laws (cf. the 2nd law of thermodynamics).
		</font>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The only way this post on talk.origins can be justified is if the laws of nature are themselves evolving. But we have no evidence that they are. Likewise, the laws of chess are not evolving (they did at one point, but they&#8217;ve been fixed now for several hundred years).
