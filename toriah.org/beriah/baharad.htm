<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Vid</i>, <i>Baharad</i> and the 6 days of 
creation</font></h2>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">According to Rebbi Eliezer the world was created over the six days from the 
25th of Ellul until the first of Tishrei&nbsp;, 5765 years ago (according to Rebbi Yehoshua this happened 6 months earlier) as discussed in 
the Talmud (Rosh Hashana 8, Tosefos, and Pirush to Rambam as below). The first 
man, <i>Adam HaRishon</i>, proclaimed 
the first new moon (the <i>molad</i>) in the 9th hour of the sixth day (the day 
of his creation) and the new moon first 
appeared 6 hours earlier in the second hour of the 6th day (this is called <i>Vid</i>, 
or the 14th hour of the 24 hour 6th day) of year 2 which started on that Friday, 
the first day of Tishrei, the day <i>Adam</i> was created. Since creation 
actually started 5 days earlier on the 25th of Ellul, the previous year, year 1, 
is extrapolated back to an imaginary Tishrei, and its new moon is called <i>Baharad</i> 
(second day, fifth hour, 204 chalakim).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, calculate forward from <i>Baharad</i> and <i>Vid</i> 
to the new moon for Tishrei of this year -- and you get Tuesday 1:15 and 17 
chalakim -- precisely the time that appears in the <i>luach</i>! Our calendar is 
consistent with the 6 days of 
creation down to a chelek (3.5 seconds)!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thanks to AB for the calculations below.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ramba&quot;m KHC 6:8 says: &quot;And the first molad from which you should start is<br>
the molad that was in the first year of Creation. It was ... at BaHaRad,<br>
and from there is the beginning of the calculation.&quot;<br>
<br>
The &quot;Peirush&quot; on the side of the Rambam there gives the description similar<br>
to the Tosafot as above, and then goes on to explain at length<br>
the three acceptable possibilities as to which year is the year known as<br>
year number one, from which we start counting. Towards the end, it says<br>
&quot;... Each one of these three opinions has the truth, because they all make<br>
the leap years at the same time [they just label the years differently] ...<br>
The one who starts the calendar at BaHaRaD will have the leap years numbered<br>
3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 19, whereas the leap years according to the second<br>
starting point (Vav-yud-dalet) are the years numbered 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16,<br>
18, and according to the third starting point the leap years are 1, 4, 6, 9,<br>
12, 15, 17. According to all versions, the leap years are at the same time<br>
because year 3 from BaHaRad is the same year as year 2 from VY&quot;D which is<br>
year number 1 from the [third starting point]. Most of the calendar<br>
scholars chose to start from BaHaRaD so as not to discard even one day of<br>
the Creation days from being part of a counted year.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, for the calculations to the present year, showing that BaHaRaD is the<br>
correct starting point:<br>
<br>
All calculations are taken mod 7 days, because we are only concerned with<br>
the position in the week.<br>
<br>
We know the offset for a month (ignoring full weeks) is:<br>
1 day 12 hours 793 chalakim (where 793 chalakim = 44 minutes + 1 chelek).<br>
Offset for a 12-month year is 12 times the above, which is:<br>
4 days 8 hours 876 chalakim (= 48 minutes 12 chalakim).<br>
Offset for a 13-month year is 13 times the one-month offset, which gives:<br>
5 days 21 hours 589 chalakim (= 32 minutes 13 chalakim).<br>
Offset for a complete 19-year cycle is 12 times the offset for a 12-month<br>
year + 7 times the offset for a 13-month year, which is:<br>
2 days 16 hours 595 chalakim.<br>
<br>
Now, if we start from the assumption that year 1 was BaHaRaD, i.e. the molad<br>
of Tishrei at year 1 was:<br>
Day 2, 5 hours 204 chalakim<br>
Then we proceed as follows.<br>
303 full 19-year cycles give a total offset of:<br>
303 times (2 days 16 hours 595 chalakim) = 606 days 4848 hours 180285<br>
chalakim = 606 days 5014 hours 1005 chalakim = 814 days 22 hours 1005<br>
chalakim = (mod 7 days) 2 days 22 hours 1005 chalakim.<br>
Add this to BaHaRad and we get a molad of:<br>
Day 5, 4 hours 129 chalakim. This should be the molad for Tishrei after 303<br>
cycles have been completed, i.e. 303*19 = 5757 full years after the<br>
beginning of year 1, i.e. Tishrei of year 5758. Which is correct - if you<br>
check a luach for 5758, the molad for Tishrei was at that time, Wednesday<br>
night at 10:07 and 3 chalakim. (And so Rosh HaShana 5758 was on Thursday<br>
according to the usual rules.)<br>
Moving forward, to our year 5765, we can add the offsets for 5 12-month<br>
years and 2 13-month years (total of 5 days 15 hours 158 chalakim) and get:<br>
Day 3, 19 hours 287 chalakim. This was the molad for Tishrei 5765, which is<br>
correct according to the luach - Tuesday 1:15 and 17 chalakim. (Rosh<br>
HaShana was postponed to Thursday because of molad zaken on Tuesday.)<br>
