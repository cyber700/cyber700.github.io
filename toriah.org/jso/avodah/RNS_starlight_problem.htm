<a href="http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/getindex.cgi?section=A#AGE OF THE UNIVERSE R SLIFKIN AND THE STARLIGHT PROBLEM">
RE: Age of the Universe (R. Slifkin and the starlight problem)</a><br>
&nbsp;<p>[RMB]<br>
&gt; But if R' Miller really said &quot;regardless of perspective&quot;, he <br>
&gt; doesn't know the relevent science or rejects its truth. (In <br>
&gt; which case, how does it account for the needed GPS software?)<br>
<br>
He knows about it but chukei hateva were not fixed until the end of the<br>
6th day.<br>
<br>
When I showed Rabbi Miller the Pioneer 11 and 12 anomalies where<br>
scientists have expressed the serious concern that general relativity is<br>
not working as predicted by Einstein at the outer reaches of the solar<br>
system (other anomalies in GR have also surfaced), he expressed the<br>
opinion (I would say pious hope :-) that the anomalies would be solved<br>
and GR would probably be upheld. But this has nothing to do with the<br>
early-universe-in-formation during the creation period. In an earlier<br>
post I referred to:<br>
<br>
1] Barrow, J.D. Cosmologies with varying light speed. Physical Review<br>
D, 59(4): 1999.<br>
<br>
[2] Barrow, J.D. Is nothing sacred? (challenging the rule that speed<br>
of light is invariable). New Scientist, 163(2): 28, 1999.<br>
<br>
[3] Magueijo, A.A.a.J. A Time Varying Speed of Light as a Solution<br>
to Cosmological Puzzles. Physical Review D, 59(4): 043516-1 to 13, 1999.<br>
<br>
[4] Reich, E.S. If the speed of light can change. New Scientist,<br>
183(2454): p6(2), 2004.<br>
<br>
[5] Magueijo, J. Plan B for the cosmos. Scientific American, 248<br>
(58-59), 2001.<br>
<br>
For example, in [3], Magueijo calculates that the speed of light may have<br>
been 60 orders of magnitude faster than the current value in the early<br>
history of the universe needed to save the big bang theory from various<br>
&quot;pirchas&quot; and as an alternative to the inflation hypothesis. Note that<br>
Magueijo is working within the normal uniformatarian assumptions of<br>
methodological naturalism that natural law always prevailed and that<br>
what we observe now gives us sound and reliable evidence for what<br>
was. Nevertheless, it is instructive that yesterday's &quot;heresy&quot; (this<br>
is how some scientists looked at this proposal originally) is today's<br>
Physical Review D. As Magueijo and Barrow point out, this challenges<br>
Einstein's proposal for the constancy of the speed of light.<br>
<br>
R. Slifkin wrote that the evidence for an old universe is vast and<br>
ovewhelming (p90 in Science of of Torah). He says that he will present<br>
evidence that is clear and easily graspable. His first piece of evidence<br>
is what is commonly called the starlight problem (no time for light to<br>
reach us from the distant stars; page 91). R. Slifkin states that the<br>
constancy of the velocity of light is a basic axiom of Einstein's theories<br>
of relativity which have passed every test that physicists have devised<br>
(p91). Unfortunately for R. Slifkin's approach, big bang cosmology has<br>
its own version of the starlight problem called the Horizon Problem. Both<br>
inflation (Plan A) and a speed-up of light by sixty orders of magnitude<br>
(Plan B) are attempts to solve Big bang's own version of this problem. You<br>
cannot very well quote the starlight problem against the Torah when big<br>
bang cosmology has its own problems in this regard, leading Magueijo<br>
and Barrow to challenge Einstein on the constancy of the speed of light.<br>
