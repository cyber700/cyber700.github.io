[RDE replied]
&gt; I am surprised that this is a matter for discussion. There are 
&gt; countless examples. Those below I cited in Daas Torah page 222. ...
&gt; p 232

&gt; *Rashbam[i] (Shemos 4:10):* It is inconceivable that a prophet who 
&gt; spoke with G-d face to face and received the Torah from Him should 
&gt; have a speech impediment....

In addition to the above quotes (from RMB and RDE), RGS writes that the
GR'A and others &quot;disputed the interpretation of the Sages&quot; (Avodah Nov 9,
see link to his blog). I believe they are not correct on this issue (on
the assumption that they intend #1 below), and in this post I will focus
on the Rashbam and the GR&quot;A, but I believe this can be suitably extended
to the other sources quoted by RDE as well (but I leave that for a later
post perhaps, time permitting). Two positions are possible. They are:

[1] The (in my view mistaken) notion that most Rishonim, when giving a
Peshat different from Chazal, do so because they believe that Chazal made
and error, and these Rishonim are therefore (c&quot;v) disputing Chazal, or

[2] The Rishonim believe that Peshat is a legitimate derech fully
authorized by Chazal, even where the Peshat is not only different from
the Derush, but even asserts what appears to be the opposite. In this
case, the Rishon merely reveals one of the Shivim Panim of Torah given
to Moshe Rabbenu at Har Sinai.

First a brief overview: The Menoras HaMeor was an early expert on
Midrash. He writes in his hakdama that with respect to halacha &quot;Ve-eyn
reshus la-shum adam leharher acherecha&quot; -- no person has the right to
criticize Chazal. This is clearly stated in TB Sanhedrin even with
respect to a single &quot;diyuk&quot; or &quot;gezeira shava&quot; of Torah She-Beal Peh and
is clearly stated by the Rishonim under discussion (e.g. Radak, Ibn Ezra,
Rashbam and even the Ralbag). I imagine that our issue is thus limited to
Agadata or Midrash not involving halacha and not involving agadata that
is from Sinai (how to tell ?), as the Talmud itself has many statements
indicating that Agadata was from Moses at Sinai or divinely inspired. The
Menoras HaMeor indicates that the limitations stated by the Gaonim only
apply to a minority of Agadata as &quot;the majority of midrashim and agada
are profound secrets&quot; and ethical instruction. But as the Rashba and
Maharal write, whereas absolute consistency is required in halacha,
the same is not required in Agadata due to the nature of this wisdom
(and herein lies the source of those who err as in #1). This is why
the Menoras HaMeor ultimately states that we are obligated to believe
in midrashim and agadata in the same way that we believe in the Torah
of Moshe Rabbeinu. This is why the Derashos Haran has harsh words to
say against those who reject the agadata of Chazal and we will likewise
quote the Rambam in full on this issue at the end of this post.

Thus I believe that RMB, RDE, and RGS would only be able to make
a compelling case for #1 if they can find a substantial number of
Rishonim who clearly and openly state that Chazal were (c&quot;v) in error
and that we therefore have the right to dispute Chazal. One should not
look at a few isolated statements of a Rishon, but should try to infer
their position from the context and the other statements that they make.

I can show this best by studying the first Rashbam quoted by RMB.

RMB writes that the Rashbam even questions &quot;vayhi erev vayhi voqer&quot;
in Beraishis as meaning that night precedes day. Now it is true that
according to the Rashbam, since creation starts with the creation of
light, the Peshat in the verse is that night follows day (see Rashbam
for the details). I asked RMB to clarify which Chazal the Rashbam was
disputing. Since RMB did not respond, I will assume for the sake of
concreteness that the Rashbam is putatively &quot;disputing&quot; Chulin 5.5,
which asserts that for halachic purposes the day follows the night. This
would appear to support #1.

However, that would be an error, as the Rashbam clearly states (Ber. 1.14
&quot;Uleyamim&quot; -- &quot;and for days') -- &quot;from one appearance of the stars until
the next appearance constitutes one day&quot;. The Rashbam is fully bound by
Chazal as in #2.

What exegetical problem was the Rashbam trying to resolve and how can
a Peshat be the opposite of a Derush Chazal and yet still be within the
constraint of &quot;shivim panim latorah&quot;? This is an interesting question and
there are a variety of possibilities, e.g. Rabbi Yaakov Kamentsky zt&quot;l
(Ber. 1.4, p17) explains that until Matan Torah the night followed the
day (see Emes LeYaakov for the full development).

Whatever the explanation, the Rashbam is a faithul follower of Chazal
as in #2. In Ber. 1.1 he asserts that &quot;... ALL of our Rabbis' words and
Midrashic explanations are HONEST and TRUE&quot;.

This is a remarkable statement that should force us to look at apparent
instances of #1 differently.

In his description of his discussion with his famous ancestor Rashi,
the Rashbam writes (Ber. 32.7) that the Midrashic methods of the Sages
which are derived from hints hiddden in the plain meaning and the use
of Midrashic exegesis such as the 32 principles of R. Eliezer or the 13
principles of R. Yishmael is the ESSENCE of the TORAH.

Midrash is the essence and Peshat is thus of secondary importance, as
the Sages say &quot;keep your children away from too much higgayan&quot; (Berachos
28b and see also BM33a). However, since the Peshat is also of (secondary)
importance (Shabbos 63a), the Rashbam undertakes its development not as
a disrepectful hetorodox activity, nor in conflict with the Midrashic
essence of the Torah as developed by the Sages, but in order to develop
one of the legitimitimate &quot;panim&quot; fully authorized by the Sages.

We see here the tremendous awe and subservience that the Rashbam (and
all Rishonim) felt towards Chazal.

Second Rashbam as per RDE.

&gt; *Rashbam[i] (Shemos 4:10):* It is inconceivable that a prophet who 
&gt; spoke with G-d face to face and received the Torah from Him should 
&gt; have a speech impediment. Such an assertion is not found in the words 
&gt; of the Tanayim and Amoraim. We don't concern ourselves with what is 
&gt; written in books outside the canon [The assertion found in Shemos Rabbah
&gt; 1:26 that Moshe stuttered] ...

The statement in brackets about Shemos Rabbah was inserted by RDE. In
RDE's hakdama to his own book he states that one authority advised him not
to present his own views or interpretations and to let the sources speak
for themselves. So while it is possible that &quot;Chitzonim&quot; could mean Shemos
Rabbah, RDE presents no evidence that this in fact what it does mean.

Whatever the case, the Rashbam clearly states that he is not contradicting
either Tannaim or Amoraim. Thus once again we have #2.

Meforshim do say a Peshat in a verse the very opposite of the Midrash,
yet this is still intended within the rubric of #2. This remarkable fact
is explained by Rabbi Chaim Friedlander zt&quot;l in the name of the GR&quot;A as
the concept of &quot;tishapech ke-chomer chosam&quot; (Iyov 38.14) -- as a seal
stamps its opposite on clay. The writing of a seal is the opposite and
the reverse of what must finally be written, and the correct text appears
only by virtue of these two opposites being there simultaneously. (Sifsei
Chayim - Pirkei Emunah u-Vechirah, vol. 2 pp. 257-272).

RGS writes that the GR'A and others &quot;DISPUTED the interpretation of the
Sages&quot; (Avodah Nov 9, see link to blog, original not in bold). But, Rabbi
Friedlander nowhere says that Rishonim or the GR'A do dispute Chazal and
find them in error (see p. 257-6, -- all the &quot;panim&quot; are true and they
do not contradict each other, and everything is included in the Torah).

For example, the Mechilta (cited by Rashi, Shemos. 21:6) which states
that a slave's ear may be pierced only on a door and not on a doorpost
(&quot;mezuzah&quot;). However, the The Vilna Gaon (Aderes Eliyahu) writes that the
simple meaning of the verse indicates that the mezuzah is also kosher&quot;
(the verse does say mezuzah). But this is an instance, says the GR&quot;A,
where the verse is &quot;ke-chomer chosam&quot;, i.e. both the halachic/midrashic
meaning (which the GR'A says uproots the Peshat) and the Peshat are
needed to arrive at a full understanding of the verse. Possibly, the
mezuzah must be in the verse to teach us another lesson viz, that why
of all vessels are door and mezuah chosen for the slave's ear -- HKBH
says that the door and the mezuzah were both witnesses in Egypt to the
redemption that the Children of Israel are servants to Him, and they are
not to be servants of servants (Kiddushin 22b). &quot;We see the importance
of trying to understand the Peshat, even when it contradicts practical
halakhah or does not match the historical reality as relayed to us by
the Sages. Every Peshat in the Torah teaches us something in hanhagah
(practice) or hashkafah (philosophy), even if we do not always understand
the lesson.&quot; (translation by RGS).

It is worthwhile to read about the awe with which the Rambam spoke about
the Midrashim of Chazal:

    (Pirush HaMishnayos, translation by RZL). Therefore, it is proper
    for us to give those Drashos the benefit of the doubt, and it would
    benefit us to carefully analyze them in depth, and not be so hasty
    as to even brush aside one word of them. When any of their words seem
    far-fetched to us, we must immerse ourselves in the various branches
    of knowledge until we understand the concepts in the matter at hand,
    if our hearts are capable of grasping them. For even the Sages, though
    they were of excellent minds, though they yearned to study, worked
    hard at their researches, were in the company of profound scholars,
    and though they kept away from all worldly matters, they would still
    assign a deficiency to themselves when comparing themselves to those
    Sages who preceded them: &quot;The greatness of the ancients is as great as
    the doorway of a vestibule, and that of the moderns is not even as big
    as the eye of a needle&quot; (Eruvin, 53A). This, then, certainly applies
    to us, from whom wisdom had ceased and disappeared. When the Holy One
    Blessed be He informed us that &quot;the wisdom of wise men shall perish
    and the understanding of men of understanding shall be obliterated&quot;
    (Isiah, 29: 14); we, each one of us whom Scriptures characterized
    as possessing four adverse qualities: (1) weakened intellect and
    (2) strengthened superficial desires, (3) laziness in the search
    for wisdom and (4) zealousness for superficial gratifications -
    the &quot;four deformities&quot; - how can we not assign the deficiency to
    ourselves, when we compare ourselves to our predecessors?!

    And because the later sages realized this fact (may they rest in
    peace), that all of their predecessors' words were clear and pure,
    with nothing superfluous stated, they commanded and exhorted us
    that no man may ridicule them: &quot;Anyone who ridicules the words of
    the Sages is sentenced to boiling excrement [in the Hereafter]&quot;
    (Gittin, 57 A). And you have no greater boiling excrement than the
    stupidity which made him degenerate into ridiculing the words of
    the Sages! Thus, you will never find anyone who brushes aside their
    words, except for a man who seeks superficial gratifications and
    overindulges in physical pleasures, one who did not enlighten his
    heart with any of the shining brilliance of Torah. And because they
    saw the truth of their words, they devoted their entire lives to
    that task of mastering the Torah, and commanded us to be diligent
    in studying it at night and for part of the day, and they deemed
    this task the height of wisdom, as it indeed is.
