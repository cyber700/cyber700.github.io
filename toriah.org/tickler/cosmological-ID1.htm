TITLE God in the Details
-->Opponents of Intelligent Design (ID) criticize it as &quot;God in the gaps.&quot; This 
				is intended pejoratively, with a meaning that is clear: if a 
				natural explanation is, at the moment, not forthcoming, then it 
				is cheap and easy to claim &quot;God did it.&quot; After all, the argument 
				continues, we do science precisely because natural explanations 
				are not forthcoming for all interesting questions. <br>
				<br>
				The &quot;God in the gaps&quot; criticism is most often heard in the 
				evolution debate. Naturally so, for what biological IDers 
				complain about, to a large extent, are in fact <i>gaps</i>. Gaps 
				in the fossil record, and knowledge gaps in the explanation of 
				complexity.<br>
				<br>
				I am not a participant in the evolution debate. If I were, I'd 
				spend my efforts on the question of whether there was sufficient 
				time for evolution, not on the gaps in the fossil record.<br>
				<br>
				But, like I said, that's not my fight. I am in the cosmological 
				ID camp. As you are probably aware, cosmological ID theory is 
				based on two observations about our universe: its fine tuning 
				and its uniqueness. Take either support beam away, and the 
				cosmological ID house falls down. <br>
				<br>
				If there is no fine tuning, then there is no evidence for 
				design.<br>
				<br>
				If our universe is not unique, i.e., if we are but one of 
				perhaps an infinite number of parallel universes, then one can 
				logically posit that our particular universe is fine-tuned only 
				because if it were not, we wouldn't be here to talk about it. 
				The multitude of universes, those that are not fine tuned, being 
				sterile, contain no intelligence pondering why they exist in an 
				ordinary, run of the mill cosmos.<br>
				<br>
				Since there is active research in these areas, cosmological ID 
				is falsifiable.<br>
&nbsp;<h4>Cosmological ID abhors the gaps.</h4>
				The cosmological ID arguments are not &quot;God in the gaps.&quot; Quite 
				the opposite: they are God in the details. Perhaps in biology 
				one can claim that it is our ignorance that unreasonably opens 
				the door to ID, but in cosmology it is our knowledge, not our 
				lack thereof, that points to design. It is not the immaturity of 
				cosmology (and physics) but its achievements that pave the way 
				for ID. <br>
				<br>
				Let me give an example.<br>
				<br>
				Here is an abstract from a recent paper published in <i>
				<a target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none" href="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2004.4.460?cookieSet=1">

&nbsp;<blockquote>
					<b>Anthropic Selection for the Moon's Mass</b><br>
					Dec 2004, Vol. 4, No. 4: 460-468 <br>
					<br>
					Dr. Dave Waltham<br>
					Department of Geology, Royal Holloway University of London, 
					Egham, Surrey, United Kingdom.<br>
					<br>
					This paper investigates whether anthropic selection explains 
					the unusually large size of our Moon. It is shown that 
					obliquity stability of the Earth is possible across a wide 
					range of different starting conditions for the Earth Moon 
					system. However, the lunar mass and angular momentum from 
					the actual Earth Moon system are remarkable in that they 
					very nearly produce an unstable obliquity. This may be 
					because the particular properties of our Earth Moon system 
					simultaneously allow a stable obliquity and a slow rotation 
					rate. A slow rotation rate may have been anthropically 
					selected because it minimizes the equator pole temperature 
					difference, thus minimizing climatic fluctuations. The great 
					merit of this idea is that it can be tested using extrasolar 
					planet search programs planned for the near future. If 
					correct, such anthropic selection predicts that most 
					extrasolar planetary systems will have significantly larger 
					perturbation frequencies than our own Solar System. 
					Astrobiology 4, 460 468.</blockquote>
				<br>
				To summarize: the earth-moon system is fine tuned to produce, 
				just barely, two great benefits: stability and slow rotation. 
				This gives us predictable, moderate climates and favorable (for 
				life) day-night durations (too fast and the winds/earthquakes 
				etc. would be much more violent, too slow and the day-night and 
				pole-equator temperature differences would be too great.) What 
				the author discovered is the moon is big enough to provide these 
				benefits, as it has to be, but on the other hand if it were just 
				a little bigger an instability would result.<br>
				<br>
				He might also have added that if the moon were bigger the tides 
				would be too violent, causing excessive erosion. And if smaller, 
				they would not be as effective at replenishing the ocean with 
				nutrients. <br>
				<br>
				He might have also added that our present knowledge of planetary 
				formation suggests that it is rare for a small, inner, rocky 
				planet to have a large moon in the first place.<sup>1</sup><br>
				<br>
				I have no idea if the author is an IDer. He calls his argument 
				anthropic, which could mean that his view is simply that if it 
				weren't so, we wouldn't be here to talk about it, because the 
				planet wouldn't be habitable. However the scientific prediction 
				he makes, that a planet-moon system like ours is rare, is really 
				a prediction of cosmological ID, in my opinion.<br>
				<br>
				In any case, it is an example of fine tuning. And, more to the 
				point, the fine tuning is known to us not because we don't 
				understand something about the earth-moon system, and rotational 
				stability and drag, and climates, etc., but because we know a 
				great deal about these things. It is not a God in the gaps 
				argument, but a God in the details.<br>
&nbsp;<h4>Another &quot;ID&quot; prediction</h4>
				In a similar (though more spectacular, at least to this nuclear 
				physicist) way, I view Hoyle's anthropic prediction in 1952 of 
				an energy level in Carbon as an ID prediction as well, although 
				Hoyle would never have expressed it that way. <br>
				<br>
				It is interesting to review Hoyle's amazing prediction.<br>
				<br>
				Carbon, essential for life, is formed inside of stars. One way 
				is for three Helium nuclei to fuse:<br>
				<br>
				3He<sup>4</sup> &#8594; C<sup>12</sup><br>
				<br>
				The problem is that it requires three helium nuclei to come 
				together, which is of low probability.<br>
				<br>
				Much more likely is a two step process in which beryllium is 
				formed as a stepping stone. <br>
				<br>
				2He<sup>4</sup> &#8594; Be<sup>8</sup><br>
				He<sup>4</sup> + Be<sup>8</sup> &#8594; C<sup>12</sup><br>
				<br>
				This requires only two nuclei to interact, and even though it 
				requires it twice, it is far more likely than three nuclei being 
				in the right place at the right time.<br>
				<br>
				This is close to an explanation, but the problem Hoyle faced was 
				that the rate of the reaction He<sup>4</sup> + Be<sup>8</sup> &#8594; 
				C<sup>12</sup> was not high enough to explain the abundance of 
				carbon. <br>
				<br>
				Unless…<br>
				<br>
				At this point Hoyle makes essentially an anthropic argument. We 
				are here, as carbon based intelligent life forms, clearly we 
				wouldn't be pondering this puzzle if we weren't, so <i>somehow</i> 
				the carbon gets produced. What would enhance the rate of 
				formation is a previously unknown excited state of C<sup>12</sup> 
				at 7.7 MeV.<sup>2</sup><br>
				<br>
				Keep in mind the nature of Hoyle's prediction: it was not via 
				the usual scientific route, which would have been to model the 
				details of the physics of the carbon nucleus and show that our 
				present knowledge of nuclear interactions and many-body dynamics 
				predicts the excited state (virtually impossible in 1952). No, 
				he said, in effect, we are here, so the energy level must be 
				here as well.<br>
				<br>
				Experiments looked for and found the level as Hoyle predicted.<br>
				<br>
				If Hoyle had been an IDer, he could have claimed his prediction 
				as coming from cosmological ID. In a way he did, for (after 
				discovering more anthropic fine tuning in nuclear chemistry) he 
				would famously say: &quot;A superintellect has monkeyed with the 
				physics, as well as the chemistry and biology.&quot;<sup>3</sup><br>
				<br>
				And so it is for the hundred or so other fine-tuning examples. 
				The more we know, the more the fine-tuning argument is 
				strengthened, not weakened.<br>
				<br>
				God is very much in the details.
				<hr><sup>1</sup> <font size="1">He might have also pointed out 
				that our moon produces nearly perfect solar eclipses, a rarity 
				for any moon. Although to be fair, this (at the moment) has no 
				known benefit for habitability. It does, however, have a huge 
				scientific benefit.<br>
				<br>
				<sup>2</sup> This is essentially because the energy balance of 
				the reaction is simplified. Without that excited state it is 
				hard for the reaction to conserve energy, so it happens less 
				often, and the beryllium is not around for long. As a side 
				&quot;coincidence&quot;, the short lifetime of Be<sup>8</sup>, 10<sup>-15</sup> 
				seconds, prevents runaway fusion that would result in early 
				stellar explosions (before life-essential heavy elements are 
				formed), i.e., the <i>instability</i> of Be<sup>8</sup> leads to 
				stellar <i>stability</i>. In other words, this represents two 
				fine-tunings: the short lifetime of Be<sup>8</sup> for stellar 
				stability, and the fortuitous 7.7 MeV level of C<sup>12</sup> 
				that, in spite of the ephemeral nature of Be<sup>8</sup>, 
				permitted the reaction to proceed at the required rate.<br>
