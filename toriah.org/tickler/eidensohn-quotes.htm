<p>*Chazon Ish (Hilchos Shechita 2:16): *I believe that the legal permission to 
kill heretics only exists in a period of time where G-d's Providence is revealed 
to everyone. In other words, only in such a time when miracles are common and 
they all heard the Bas Kol (Heavenly Voice) and they saw and acknowledged the 
unique Providence for the righteous of the generation. The heretics in those 
eras -- despite the great manifestation of spirituality -- had an especially 
powerful lust for pleasure and rejecting all religious obligations. In such 
circumstances, the destruction of the wicked served the clear purpose of 
improving the world. Everyone knew that corrupt moral and violating religious 
commandments brought about suffering in the world such as plague, war and 
famine. However at a time when there is the absence of such clear awareness of 
the importance of spirituality, then killing heretics does not bring about 
improvement but rather makes things worse. That is because in such a 
non-spiritual world, the punishment of heretics is viewed as destructive and as 
religious coercion. Therefore, since the whole reason for punishing heretics is 
to improve society, it cannot apply to an era when it is not generally perceived 
as an improvement. Thus in our current situation, we are obligated to bring the 
non-observant back to the light of religion -- with acts of love and affection 
to the best of our ability.<br>
