<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The development of any major new feature 
	presents similar problems, and according to Lehigh University biochemist 
	Michael Behe, who describes several spectacular examples in detail in 
	.Darwin's Black Box. [Behe 1996], the world of microbiology is especially 
	loaded with such examples of &quot;irreducible complexity&quot;. Although I cannot 
	imagine any uses for the components of this airtight insect trap before the 
	trap was almost perfect, a good Darwinist will imagine 2 or 3 far-fetched 
	intermediate useful stages, and consider the problem solved. I believe you 
	would need to find thousands of intermediate stages before this example of 
	irreducible complexity has been reduced to steps small enough to be bridged 
	by single random mutations -- a lot of things have to happen behind the 
	scenes and at the microscopic level before this trap could catch and digest 
	insects. But I don't know how to prove this. I am furthermore sure that even 
	if you could find a long chain of useful intermediate stages, each would 
	present such a negligible selective advantage that nothing as clever as this 
	insect trap could ever be produced, but I can't prove that either. Finally, 
	that natural selection seems even remotely plausible depends on the fact 
	that while species are awaiting further improvements, their current complex 
	structure is &quot;locked in&quot;, and passed on perfectly through many generations. 
	This phenomenon is observed, but inexplicable -- I don't see any reason why 
	all living organisms do not constantly decay into simpler components --&nbsp; 
	as, in fact, they do as soon as they die. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When you look at the individual steps in 
	the development of life, Darwin's explanation is difficult to disprove, 
	because some selective advantage can be imagined in almost anything. Like 
	every other device designed to violate the second law, it is only when you 
	look at the net result that it becomes obvious it won't work. Darwinists 
	point to the similarities between species (fossil and living) as evidence 
	that the development of life was guided by natural selection, but these 
	similarities do not really tell us anything about causes. In fact, the 
	fossil record does not even support the idea that new organs and new systems 
	of organs arose gradually: orders, classes and phyla consistently appear 
	suddenly. For example, Harvard palaeontologist George Gaylord Simpson 
	[Simpson 1960] writes:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is a feature of the known fossil 
		record that most taxa appear abruptly. They are not, as a rule, led up 
		to by a sequence of almost imperceptibly changing forerunners such as 
		Darwin believed should be usual in evolution...This phenomenon becomes 
		more universal and more intense as the hierarchy of categories is 
		ascended. Gaps among known species are sporadic and often small. Gaps 
		among known orders, classes and phyla are systematic and almost always 
		large. These peculiarities of the record pose one of the most important 
		theoretical problems in the whole history of life: Is the sudden 
		appearance of higher categories a phenomenon of evolution or of the 
		record only, due to sampling bias and other inadequacies?.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I always thought that, despite creationist 
contentions, that evolution does not violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics. 
However, Sewell writes:</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The discovery that life on Earth developed 
	through evolutionary &quot;steps&quot;, coupled with the observation that mutations 
	and natural selection -- like other natural forces -- can cause (minor) 
	change, is widely accepted in the scientificc world as proof that natural 
	selection -- alone among all natural forces -- can create order out of 
	disorder, and even design human brains, with human consciousness. Only the 
	layman seems to see the problem with this logic. In a recent Mathematical 
	Intelligencer article [Sewell 2000], after outlining the specificc reasons 
	why it is not reasonable to attribute the major steps in the development of 
	life to natural selection, I asserted that the idea that the four 
	fundamental forces of physics alone could rearrange the fundamental 
	particles of Nature into spaceships, nuclear power plants, and computers, 
	connected to laser printers, CRTs, keyboards and the Internet, appears to 
	violate the second law of thermodynamics in a spectacular way ....</font></p>
